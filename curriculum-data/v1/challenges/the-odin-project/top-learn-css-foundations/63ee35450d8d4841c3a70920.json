  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Internal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <code>&#x3C;style></code> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags of your HTML file. Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags, you no longer need a <code>&#x3C;link></code> element that the external method requires.</p>\n<p>Besides these differences, the syntax is exactly the same as the external method (selector, curly braces, declarations):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;style>\n    div {\n      color: white;\n      background-color: black;\n    }\n\n    p {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  &#x3C;/style>\n&#x3C;/head>\n&#x3C;body>...&#x3C;/body>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website, but it doesnâ€™t keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.</p>\n</section>",
