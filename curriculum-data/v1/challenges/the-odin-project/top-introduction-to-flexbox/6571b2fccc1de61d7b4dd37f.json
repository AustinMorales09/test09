  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<h2>Before we get started</h2>\n<p>Flexbox layouts can get a little complicated. In a previous lesson, you learned how to inspect and debug things using your browser’s developer tools. Those tools will be crucial for you in the following lessons. If something isn’t behaving the way you expect, inspecting it in the developer tools should be your first step every time.</p>\n<p>Flexbox isn’t necessarily any more difficult than the other concepts that we’ve covered so far, but it does have a few more moving parts. It is going to be somewhat difficult to make use of any of the things you’re learning in these first lessons until you get to the end and can put it all together. As we go, do yourself a favor and <strong>play with all of the code examples.</strong></p>\n<p>You will almost definitely need to come back and reference these lessons (or a couple of the resources we share with you) when you get to the assignments at the end of the section, but if you take your time and experiment with all the code examples we provide, you’ll know better where to look when that time comes.</p>\n<h2>Let’s flex</h2>\n<p>Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns. These items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink) based on some simple rules that you can define. To get started, let’s look at a simple demonstration.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We’ve embedded a lot of interactive examples in these lessons. Take your time to experiment with them as you go to cement the concepts in your mind!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowpaymentrequest=\"true\" allowtransparency=\"true\"  frameborder=\"0\" height=\"400\" width=\"100%\" name=\"cp_embed_1\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/embed/QWgNxrp?height=400&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;slug-hash=QWgNxrp&amp;editable=true&amp;user=TheOdinProjectExamples&amp;name=cp_embed_1\" style=\"width: 100%; overflow:hidden; display:block;\" title=\"CodePen Embed\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>We’ll get into exactly what’s going on here soon enough. But for now, let’s uncomment the two flex related CSS declarations in the above Codepen by removing the <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> tags surrounding them, then check out the result.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Comments prevent the browser from interpreting lines as code, and are wrapped between specific tags. CSS uses <code>/*</code> as an opening comment tag and <code>*/</code> as a closing comment tag, while HTML and JavaScript have their own syntax. Commented out lines of code can be re-enabled simply by removing the comment tags surrounding the code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All 3 divs should now be arranged horizontally. If you resize the results frame with the <code>1x</code>, <code>.5x</code> and <code>.25x</code> buttons you’ll also see that the <code>div</code> elements will \"flex\". They will fill the available area and will each have equal width.</p>\n<p>If you add another <code>div</code> to the HTML, inside of <code>.flex-container</code>, it will show up alongside the others, and everything will flex to fit within the available area.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it’s hard to see what's going on in the small embedded CodePen, feel free to click the \"Edit on CodePen\" or \"Fork on CodePen\" button. This will bring the example into a full-sized environment. Some of the later examples might especially benefit from doing this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</section>",
