You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database. Here is a sample of what the data looks like:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-markdown\">|    |   age | workclass        |   fnlwgt | education   |   education-num | marital-status     | occupation        | relationship   | race   | sex    |   capital-gain |   capital-loss |   hours-per-week | native-country   | salary   |\n|---:|------:|:-----------------|---------:|:------------|----------------:|:-------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------|:-------|---------------:|---------------:|-----------------:|:-----------------|:---------|\n|  0 |    39 | State-gov        |    77516 | Bachelors   |              13 | Never-married      | Adm-clerical      | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |           2174 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | &#x3C;=50K    |\n|  1 |    50 | Self-emp-not-inc |    83311 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Exec-managerial   | Husband        | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               13 | United-States    | &#x3C;=50K    |\n|  2 |    38 | Private          |   215646 | HS-grad     |               9 | Divorced           | Handlers-cleaners | Not-in-family  | White  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | &#x3C;=50K    |\n|  3 |    53 | Private          |   234721 | 11th        |               7 | Married-civ-spouse | Handlers-cleaners | Husband        | Black  | Male   |              0 |              0 |               40 | United-States    | &#x3C;=50K    |\n|  4 |    28 | Private          |   338409 | Bachelors   |              13 | Married-civ-spouse | Prof-specialty    | Wife           | Black  | Female |              0 |              0 |               40 | Cuba             | &#x3C;=50K    |\n</code></pre>\n<p>You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (<code>race</code> column)</li>\n<li>What is the average age of men?</li>\n<li>What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?</li>\n<li>What percentage of people with advanced education (<code>Bachelors</code>, <code>Masters</code>, or <code>Doctorate</code>) make more than 50K?</li>\n<li>What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?</li>\n<li>What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?</li>\n<li>What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?</li>\n<li>What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?</li>\n<li>Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use the starter code in the file <code>demographic_data_analyzer.py</code>. Update the code so all variables set to <code>None</code> are set to the appropriate calculation or code. Round all decimals to the nearest tenth.</p>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>Write your code in <code>demographic_data_analyzer.py</code>. For development, you can use <code>main.py</code> to test your code.</p>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>The unit tests for this project are in <code>test_module.py</code>. We imported the tests from <code>test_module.py</code> to <code>main.py</code> for your convenience.</p>\n<h2>Submitting</h2>\n<p>Copy your project's URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp.</p>\n<h2>Dataset Source</h2>\n<p>Dua, D. and Graff, C.
