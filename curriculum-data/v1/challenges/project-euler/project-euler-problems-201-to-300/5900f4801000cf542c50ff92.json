For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the $y$-axis) is counted as one sculpture:</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"18 balanced sculptures of order 6\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/balanced-sculptures.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.</p>\n<p>How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?</p>\n</section>",
