  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Larry and Robin play a memory game involving of a sequence of random numbers between 1 and 10, inclusive, that are called out one at a time. Each player can remember up to 5 previous numbers. When the called number is in a player's memory, that player is awarded a point. If it's not, the player adds the called number to his memory, removing another number if his memory is full.</p>\n<p>Both players start with empty memories. Both players always add new missed numbers to their memory but use a different strategy in deciding which number to remove: Larry's strategy is to remove the number that hasn't been called in the longest time. Robin's strategy is to remove the number that's been in the memory the longest time.</p>\n<p>Example game:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Turn</th>\n<th>Called number</th>\n<th align=\"right\">Larry's memory</th>\n<th>Larry's score</th>\n<th>Robin's memory</th>\n<th>Robin's score</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1,2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1,2,4</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>6</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1,2,4,6</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4,6,8</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1,2,4,6,8</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,6,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>2,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td align=\"right\">1,2,4,8,10</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1,4,6,8,10</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Denoting Larry's score by $L$ and Robin's score by $R$, what is the expected value of $|L - R|$ after 50 turns?
