However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile, the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected piles.</p>\n<p>In other words, the player chooses some $N > 0$ and removes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$N$ stones from any single pile; or</li>\n<li>$N$ stones from each of any two piles ($2N$ total); or</li>\n<li>$N$ stones from each of the three piles ($3N$ total).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.</p>\n<p>A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.</p>\n<p>For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11) and (5,5,5) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.</p>\n<p>A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.</p>\n<p>For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.</p>\n<p>Consider all losing configurations ($x_i$,$y_i$,$z_i$) where $x_i ≤ y_i ≤ z_i ≤ 100$. We can verify that $\\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i) = 173\\,895$ for these.</p>\n<p>Find $\\sum (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ where ($x_i$,$y_i$,$z_i$) ranges over the losing configurations with $x_i ≤ y_i ≤ z_i ≤ 1000$.</p>\n</section>",
