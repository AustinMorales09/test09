He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order.</p>\n<p>As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Piece Placed</th>\n<th>Segments So Far</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td>3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>34</td>\n<td>5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>35</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>…</td>\n<td>…</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Let $M$ be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.
