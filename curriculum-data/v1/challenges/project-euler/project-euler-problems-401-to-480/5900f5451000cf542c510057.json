If there is more than one choice satisfying this condition, then the person chooses the leftmost choice.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that due to rule 1, some seats will surely be left unoccupied, and the maximum number of people that can be seated is less than $N$ (for $N > 1$).</p>\n<p>Here are the possible seating arrangements for $N = 15$:</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"seating arrangements for N = 15\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/comfortable-distance-ii.png\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>We see that if the first person chooses correctly, the 15 seats can seat up to 7 people.

Thus, $f(1) = 1$, $f(15) = 9$, $f(20) = 6$, and $f(500) = 16$.</p>\n<p>Also, $\\sum f(N) = 83$ for $1 ≤ N ≤ 20$ and $\\sum f(N) = 13\\,343$ for $1 ≤ N ≤ 500$.</p>\n<p>Find $\\sum f(N)$ for $1 ≤ N ≤ {10}^{12}$.
