  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A group of $p$ people decide to sit down at a round table and play a lottery-ticket trading game. Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.</p>\n<p>An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.</li>\n<li>The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>\n<p>Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of his ticket winnings.</p>\n<p>Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players (e.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits).</p>\n<p>Let $S_1(N) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{p = 1}^N E(p)$.</p>\n<p>Let $S_k(N) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{p = 1}^N S_{k - 1}(p)$ for $k > 1$.</p>\n<p>Find $S_{20}({10}^{14})$ and write the answer as a string in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase <code>e</code> to separate mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would be <code>5.983679014e5</code>.</p>\n</section>",
