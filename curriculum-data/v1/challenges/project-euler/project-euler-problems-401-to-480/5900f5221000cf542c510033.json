  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Julie proposes the following wager to her sister Louise.</p>\n<p>She suggests they play a game of chance to determine who will wash the dishes.</p>\n<p>For this game, they shall use a generator of independent random numbers uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>The game starts with $S = 0$.</p>\n<p>The first player, Louise, adds to $S$ different random numbers from the generator until $S > 1$ and records her last random number '$x$'.</p>\n<p>The second player, Julie, continues adding to $S$ different random numbers from the generator until $S > 2$ and records her last random number '$y$'.</p>\n<p>The player with the highest number wins and the loser washes the dishes, i.e. if $y > x$ the second player wins.</p>\n<p>For example, if the first player draws 0.62 and 0.44, the first player turn ends since $0.62 + 0.44 > 1$ and $x = 0.44$. If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn ends since $0.62 + 0.44 + 0.1 + 0.27 + 0.91 > 2$ and $y = 0.91$. Since $y > x$, the second player wins.</p>\n<p>Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: \"That's not fair\".</p>\n<p>What is the probability that the second player wins? Give your answer rounded to 10 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghij</p>\n</section>",
