The player who rolls the highest value wins.</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die $A$ and the second player picks die $B$ we get</p>\n<p>$P(\\text{second player wins}) = \\frac{7}{12} > \\frac{1}{2}$</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die $B$ and the second player picks die $C$ we get</p>\n<p>$P(\\text{second player wins}) = \\frac{7}{12} > \\frac{1}{2}$</p>\n<p>If the first player picks die $C$ and the second player picks die $A$ we get</p>\n<p>$P(\\text{second player wins}) = \\frac{25}{36} > \\frac{1}{2}$</p>\n<p>So whatever die the first player picks, the second player can pick another die and have a larger than 50% chance of winning. A set of dice having this property is called a nontransitive set of dice.</p>\n<p>We wish to investigate how many sets of nontransitive dice exist. We will assume the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are three six-sided dice with each side having between 1 and $N$ pips, inclusive.</li>\n<li>Dice with the same set of pips are equal, regardless of which side on the die the pips are located.</li>\n<li>The same pip value may appear on multiple dice; if both players roll the same value neither player wins.</li>\n<li>The sets of dice $\\{A, B, C\\}$, $\\{B, C, A\\}$ and $\\{C, A, B\\}$ are the same set.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For $N = 7$ we find there are 9780 such sets.</p>\n<p>How many are there for $N = 30$?</p>\n</section>",
