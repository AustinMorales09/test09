  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: $ABCD$. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order.</p>\n<p>To rearrange the carriages, they are all shunted onto a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point, the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180Â°. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.</p>\n<p>Some arrangements, such as $ADCB$, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between $A$ and $D$, and after $DCB$ are rotated the correct order has been achieved.</p>\n<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage $A$ in the correct place, then carriage $B$, and so on.</p>\n<p>Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are $DACB$ and $DBAC$; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for $DACB$ is shown below.</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"five rotations for maximix arrangement DACB\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/maximix-arrangements.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is $DFAECB$.</p>\n<p>Find the ${2011}^{\\text{th}}$ lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.</p>\n</section>",
