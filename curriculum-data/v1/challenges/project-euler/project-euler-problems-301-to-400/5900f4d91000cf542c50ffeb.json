The value $v > 0$ is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines $OP_0$, $OP_3$ and the curve is equal to $\\frac{π}{4}$ (the area of the quarter circle).</p>\n<p>By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the quarter circle? That is, if $L$ is the length of the curve, calculate $100 × \\displaystyle\\frac{L − \\frac{π}{2}}{\\frac{π}{2}}$. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>",
