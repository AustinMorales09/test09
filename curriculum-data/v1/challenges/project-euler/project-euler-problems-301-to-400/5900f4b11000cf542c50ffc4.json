  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A game is played with two piles of stones and two players. On each player's turn, the player may remove a number of stones from the larger pile. The number of stones removes must be a positive multiple of the number of stones in the smaller pile.</p>\n<p>E.g., let the ordered pair (6,14) describe a configuration with 6 stones in the smaller pile and 14 stones in the larger pile, then the first player can remove 6 or 12 stones from the larger pile.</p>\n<p>The player taking all the stones from a pile wins the game.</p>\n<p>A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win. For example, (1,5), (2,6) and (3,12) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones in the second pile.</p>\n<p>A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does. For example, (2,3) and (3,4) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.</p>\n<p>Define $S(N)$ as the sum of ($x_i + y_i$) for all losing configurations ($x_i$, $y_i$), $0 &#x3C; x_i &#x3C; y_i â‰¤ N$. We can verify that $S(10) = 211$ and $S({10}^4) = 230\\,312\\,207\\,313$.</p>\n<p>Find $S({10}^{16})\\bmod 7^{10}$.</p>\n</section>",
