It is possible to place four such triangles together to form a square with length c.</p>\n<p>For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5 square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5 square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares.</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"two 5 x 5 squares: one with four 3x4x5 triangles placed to create 1x1 hole in the middle; second with twenty-five 1x1 squares\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/pythagorean-tiles.png\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used, the hole would measure 7 by 7. These 7 by 7 squares could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.</p>\n<p>Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to occur?</p>\n</section>",
