One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that size 2 triangle.</p>\n<p>It can be observed that the size 2 triangle contains 4 size 1 triangle building blocks. A size 3 triangle would contain 9 size 1 triangle building blocks and a size $n$ triangle would thus contain $n^2$ size 1 triangle building blocks.</p>\n<p>If we denote $T(n)$ as the number of triangles present in a triangle of size $n$, then</p>\n<p>$$\\begin{align}\n&#x26; T(1) = 16 \\\\\n&#x26; T(2) = 104\n\\end{align}$$</p>\n<p>Find $T(36)$.</p>\n</section>",
