  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A positive integer, $n$, is divided by $d$ and the quotient and remainder are $q$ and $r$ respectively. In addition $d$, $q$, and $r$ are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.</p>\n<p>For example, 58 divided by 6 has a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 4. It can also be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common ratio $\\frac{3}{2}$).</p>\n<p>We will call such numbers, $n$, progressive.</p>\n<p>Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = ${102}^2$, also happen to be perfect squares. The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one hundred thousand is 124657.</p>\n<p>Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion (${10}^{12}$).</p>\n</section>",
