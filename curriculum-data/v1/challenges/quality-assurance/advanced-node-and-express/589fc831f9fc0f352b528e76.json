  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>You may notice that up to now you have only been increasing the user count. Handling a user disconnecting is just as easy as handling the initial connect, except you have to listen for it on each socket instead of on the whole server.</p>\n<p>To do this, add another listener inside the existing <code>'connect'</code> listener that listens for <code>'disconnect'</code> on the socket with no data passed through. You can test this functionality by just logging that a user has disconnected to the console.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">socket.on('disconnect', () => {\n  /*anything you want to do on disconnect*/\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>To make sure clients continuously have the updated count of current users, you should decrease <code>currentUsers</code> by 1 when the disconnect happens then emit the <code>'user count'</code> event with the updated count.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just like <code>'disconnect'</code>, all other events that a socket can emit to the server should be handled within the connecting listener where we have 'socket' defined.</p>\n<p>Submit your page when you think you've got it right.
