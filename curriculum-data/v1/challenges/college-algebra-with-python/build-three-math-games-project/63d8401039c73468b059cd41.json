  "instructions": "<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python that do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scatter plot game\n<ul>\n<li>Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates</li>\n<li>For added difficulty, make the graph larger</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Algebra practice game\n<ul>\n<li>Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player has to input the answer</li>\n<li>Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, make the numbers larger</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Projectile game\n<ul>\n<li>Display a \"wall\" with random height and location. Player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall</li>\n<li>For added difficulty, make a second level where players enter a, b, and c without sliders</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.</p>\n</section>",
