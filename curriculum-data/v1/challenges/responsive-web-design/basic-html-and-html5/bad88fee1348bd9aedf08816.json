You then need to add the same <code>id</code> attribute to the element you are linking to. An <code>id</code> is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;a href=\"#contacts-header\">Contacts&#x3C;/a>\n...\n&#x3C;h2 id=\"contacts-header\">Contacts&#x3C;/h2>\n</code></pre>\n<p>When users click the <code>Contacts</code> link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the <strong>Contacts</strong> heading element.</p>\n</section>",
