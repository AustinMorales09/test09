  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In the last challenge, you learned that including an <code>alt</code> attribute when using <code>img</code> tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases, <code>alt</code> text may seem redundant or unnecessary.</p>\n<p>When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the <code>img</code> still needs an <code>alt</code> attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;img src=\"visualDecoration.jpeg\" alt=\"\">\n</code></pre>\n<p>Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> For images with a caption, you may still want to include <code>alt</code> text since it helps search engines catalog the image's content.</p>\n</section>",
  "instructions": "<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual break between his two articles with a decorative image of a samurai sword. Add an <code>alt</code> attribute to the <code>img</code> tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image <code>src</code> doesn't link to an actual file - don't worry that there are no swords showing in the display.)</p>\n</section>",
