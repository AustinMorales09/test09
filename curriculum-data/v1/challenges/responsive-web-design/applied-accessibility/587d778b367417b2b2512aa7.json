Each choice is given a <code>label</code> with a <code>for</code> attribute tying to the <code>id</code> of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.</p>\n<p>The <code>fieldset</code> tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a <code>legend</code> tag to provide a description for the grouping, which screen readers read for each choice in the <code>fieldset</code> element.</p>\n<p>The <code>fieldset</code> wrapper and <code>legend</code> tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a <code>label</code> with the <code>for</code> attribute for each radio button is sufficient.</p>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;form>\n  &#x3C;fieldset>\n    &#x3C;legend>Choose one of these three items:&#x3C;/legend>\n    &#x3C;input id=\"one\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"one\">\n    &#x3C;label for=\"one\">Choice One&#x3C;/label>&#x3C;br>\n    &#x3C;input id=\"two\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"two\">\n    &#x3C;label for=\"two\">Choice Two&#x3C;/label>&#x3C;br>\n    &#x3C;input id=\"three\" type=\"radio\" name=\"items\" value=\"three\">\n    &#x3C;label for=\"three\">Choice Three&#x3C;/label>\n  &#x3C;/fieldset>\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n</section>",
