Sufficient contrast improves your content's readability, but what exactly does \"sufficient\" mean?</p>\n<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 for white against black, the most substantial contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for you.</p>\n</section>",
