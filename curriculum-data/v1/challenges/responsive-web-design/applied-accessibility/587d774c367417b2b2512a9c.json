  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>You've likely seen an <code>alt</code> attribute on an <code>img</code> tag in other challenges. <code>alt</code> text describes the image's content and provides a text-alternative for it. An <code>alt</code> attribute helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. Search engines also use it to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;img src=\"importantLogo.jpeg\" alt=\"Company logo\">\n</code></pre>\n<p>People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the <code>alt</code> attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.</p>\n<p>Good <code>alt</code> text provides the reader a brief description of the image. You should always include an <code>alt</code> attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.</p>\n</section>",

The profile picture he wants to use shows his skills and should be appreciated by all site visitors. Add an <code>alt</code> attribute in the <code>img</code> tag, that explains Camper Cat is doing karate. (The image <code>src</code> doesn't link to an actual file, so you should see the <code>alt</code> text in the display.)</p>\n</section>",
