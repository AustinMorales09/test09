  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names and attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.</p>\n<p>The <code>label</code> tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The <code>for</code> attribute on a <code>label</code> tag explicitly associates that <code>label</code> with the form control and is used by screen readers.</p>\n<p>You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a <code>label</code> element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the <code>for</code> attribute, as explained in this lesson.</p>\n<p>The value of the <code>for</code> attribute must be the same as the value of the <code>id</code> attribute of the form control. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;form>\n  &#x3C;label for=\"name\">Name:&#x3C;/label>\n  &#x3C;input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\">\n&#x3C;/form>\n</code></pre>\n</section>",
