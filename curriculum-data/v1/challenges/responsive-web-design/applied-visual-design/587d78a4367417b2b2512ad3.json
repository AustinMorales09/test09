  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.</p>\n</section>",
  "instructions": "<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>This page will use a shade of teal (<code>#09A7A1</code>) as the dominant color, and its orange (<code>#FF790E</code>) complement to visually highlight the sign-up buttons. Change the <code>background-color</code> of both the <code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> from black to the teal color. Then change the <code>h2</code> text <code>color</code> to teal as well. Finally, change the <code>background-color</code> of the <code>button</code> to the orange color.</p>\n</section>",
