This is useful for finding out about someone's everyday activities, which is a common topic of small talk.</p>\n<p>Note: When you use <code>do</code> as an auxiliary verb in a question, the main verb must stay in its base form. For example:</p>\n<p>Statement: <code>She works as a Full Stack dev.</code></p>\n<p>Question: <code>Does she work as a Full Stack dev?</code></p>\n<p><code>work</code> stays as <code>work</code> and does not change to <code>works</code>, even when asking about a third person singular subject like <code>he,</code> <code>she,</code> or <code>it.</code></p>\n</section>",
