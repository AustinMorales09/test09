  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In this part of the dialogue, Sarah suggests playing <code>Gartic</code> on the next game night. She uses the phrases <code>Maybe</code> and <code>we can</code> to express the possibility of this happening.</p>\n<p><code>Maybe</code> is a word used when you are suggesting a possibility, but you are not sure if this possibility will happen or not. It shows that you are not making a definite plan, but you are open to the idea. For example: if someone asks you if you want to go to the movies, you can say <code>Maybe</code> if you are not sure if you want to go or if you are available.</p>\n<p><code>We can</code> is used to suggest an idea or propose something in a polite way. It shows that the people in the conversation have the ability or the option to do something. For example, if you want to suggest playing a game, you can say <code>We can play a game</code> to offer the idea.</p>\n<p>The difference between <code>maybe</code> and <code>we can</code> is that <code>maybe</code> suggests a possibility without making a definite plan, while <code>we can</code> suggests an idea or proposal in a polite way.</p>\n</section>",
