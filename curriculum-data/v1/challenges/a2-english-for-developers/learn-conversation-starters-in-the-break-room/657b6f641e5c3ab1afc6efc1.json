  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Before you learned to ask questions using <code>do,</code> you can also use the auxiliary verb to in negative sentences. In negative sentences you combine the auxiliary verb <code>do</code> (I, you, we, they) or <code>does</code> (he, she it) with the word <code>not</code> and place it right before the main verb:</p>\n<p><code>I do not work everyday</code> - (Subject + do + not + main verb)</p>\n<p><code>It does not function</code> - (Subject + does + not + main verb)</p>\n<p>Often, to be more practical it is common to abbreviate <code>do not</code> and <code>does not</code> to <code>don’t</code> and <code>doesn’t</code>.</p>\n<p>Just like with questions, when you use <code>don't,</code> the main verb that comes after it will always be in its base form, no matter who you're talking about. Remember, you use <code>don't</code> with I, you, we, and they. When you talk about he, she, or it, you will use <code>doesn't,</code> but more on that later. Right now, let's focus on using <code>don't.</code></p>\n</section>",
