  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When you want to learn about a person’s character or personality without specifying their gender, you can use <code>they</code> as a singular pronoun and ask, <code>What are they like?</code>.</p>\n<p>This is a respectful and inclusive way to ask about someone. Using <code>they</code> in this way ensures that you don't make assumptions about people. Example:</p>\n<p>Imagine there is a new team member joining your programming project, but you haven’t met them yet. Instead of assuming their gender, you can ask your supervisor, <code>What are they like?</code></p>\n<p>This question helps you find out about the new member's personality, such as being organized, creative, or detail-oriented.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The question <code>What are they like?</code> can also refer to multiple people or a group. For example, if you're asking about a new team or a group of people you will be working with, you can use this question to learn about the group's personality or dynamic.</p>\n</section>",
