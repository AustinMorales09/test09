It is used when talking about a time that started in the past and continues to the present. If someone asks, <code>Are you happy with the workplace so far?</code> They want to know if you liked your workplace from the first day up to today.</p>\n<p>Another example: if you say, <code>The project is good so far,</code> it means from the beginning of the project until now, everything is good.</p>\n<p>In our dialogue, Sarah asks Tom if he is happy with his new job so far. She is asking about his time at the job from the beginning until their conversation.</p>\n</section>",
