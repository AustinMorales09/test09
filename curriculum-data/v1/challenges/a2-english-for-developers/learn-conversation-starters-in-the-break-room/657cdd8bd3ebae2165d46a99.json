  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In English, the verb <code>sound</code> means to give an impression of something when heard or described. When talking about how something seems, based on what you have heard, you use <code>sounds</code> for the third person singular (it).</p>\n<p>In the dialogue, Tom uses <code>sounds</code> after hearing Sophie's description of Maria's responsibilities. This form is correct because Tom is talking about one specific thing (Maria's role), which is considered a singular subject.</p>\n<p>That is why he says \"That <code>sounds</code> important\" instead of \"that <code>sound</code> important\".</p>\n</section>",
