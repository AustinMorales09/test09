  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>So far you have learned how to create questions with the verb to be. In sentences with the verb <code>to be</code> (am, is, are) you just have to change the order of the noun and the verb to create a question. Like this:</p>\n<p><code>You are a developer</code> -> <code>Are you a developer?</code></p>\n<p>Changing the order of the noun and the verb doesnâ€™t work in every situation. Most sentences need you to add an auxiliary verb to create questions. One of the most common auxiliary verbs is <code>Do</code>.</p>\n<p>You can use the verb <code>do</code> as an auxiliary to most verbs. In the present tense it assumes the form of <code>do</code> (I, you, we, they) and <code>does</code>(he, she, it). It is like a marker you will add to the beginning of your sentence and lets everyone know that sentence is a question. For example:</p>\n<p>Statement: <code>You debug on Fridays.</code>\nQuestion: <code>Do you debug on Fridays?</code></p>\n</section>",
