Example:</p>\n<p>Imagine you meet a new student in your programming class and you want to know more about her. You can ask a classmate <code>What is she like?</code>.</p>\n<p>You are not asking if the new student likes computers or games; you are asking about her personality. Maybe she's friendly, smart, or really good at coding.</p>\n</section>",
