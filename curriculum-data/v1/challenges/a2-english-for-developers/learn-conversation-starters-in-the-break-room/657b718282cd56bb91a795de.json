  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In English, some verbs are conjugated. This means they change the form according to the person you are talking about. For most verbs, when we talk about another person like <code>he,</code> <code>she,</code> or <code>it,</code> we add an <code>-s</code> or <code>-es</code> to the verb.</p>\n<p>For example: If you talk about Tom and photography you can say: <code>Tom takes photographs,</code> not <code>Tom take photographs.</code> This is how you show in your sentence that the action is done by Tom in the present tense.</p>\n<p>For negative sentences, you can use <code>doesn't</code> followed by the base form of the verb.</p>\n<p>You do not add <code>-s</code> or <code>-es.</code> because <code>does</code> is already conjugated (<code>do+es</code>).</p>\n<p>For example, if Tom doesn't do video recording as a hobby, you can say, <code>He doesn't record videos.</code>.</p>\n<p>Understanding this difference is crucial for talking about habits and actions accurately. Now, let's apply this understanding to what Sophie does in her free time.</p>\n</section>",
