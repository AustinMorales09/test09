  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When a verb follows a preposition, it often takes the <code>-ing</code> form, known as a gerund. Gerunds are verbs acting as nouns. This rule is common in many English expressions. For example:</p>\n<p><code>After eating dinner, we watched a movie.</code> (<code>eating</code> follows the preposition <code>after</code>)</p>\n<p><code>She is interested in learning Spanish.</code> (<code>learning</code> follows the preposition <code>in</code>)</p>\n<p><code>Before going to bed, I like to read.</code> (<code>going</code> follows the preposition <code>before</code>)</p>\n</section>",
