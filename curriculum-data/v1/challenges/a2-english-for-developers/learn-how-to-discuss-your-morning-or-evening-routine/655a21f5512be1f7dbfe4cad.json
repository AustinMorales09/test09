  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Words ending in <code>y</code> often describe a state or quality. For example:</p>\n<p>If you add <code>y</code> to the noun <code>sleep</code>, you create the adjective <code>sleepy</code>, which means feeling a need to sleep or being tired.</p>\n<p>The <code>y</code> transforms the noun <code>sleep</code> into an adjective describing a condition. Similarly:</p>\n<p><code>snow</code> + <code>y</code> = <code>snowy</code> (having a lot of snow)\n<code>rain</code> + <code>y</code> = <code>rainy</code> (having a lot of rain)</p>\n</section>",
