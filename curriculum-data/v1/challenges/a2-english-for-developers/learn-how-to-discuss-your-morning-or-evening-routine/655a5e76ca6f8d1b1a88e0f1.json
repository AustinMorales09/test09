  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Regular verbs usually add <code>-ed</code> to form the past tense. This can also result in some adjectives as in the dialogue.</p>\n<p><code>Complicated</code> is the past tense form of the regular verb <code>complicate</code>, as well as the adjective that means something is not simple or easy to do. One example of it as a verb can be: <code>The problems on the road complicated our trip.</code></p>\n<p><code>I walked to the store</code> (Past tense of <code>walk</code>)</p>\n<p><code>She cleaned her room yesterday</code> (Past tense of <code>clean</code>)</p>\n<p>Extra note to help with the audio:</p>\n<p><code>Running around</code> means moving about in a hurried or energetic way, often chaotically. For example:</p>\n<p><code>The kids are running around the playground</code></p>\n</section>",
