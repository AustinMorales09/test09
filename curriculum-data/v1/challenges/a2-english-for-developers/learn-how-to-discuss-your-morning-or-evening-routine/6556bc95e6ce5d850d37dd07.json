  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Adjectives are words that describe or give more information about nouns or pronouns. For example, in the phrase <code>the blue sky</code>, <code>blue</code> is an adjective describing the sky.</p>\n<p>Notice how the adjective comes before the noun. It is <code>blue sky</code> not <code>sky blue</code>.</p>\n<p>Expressive language can include idiomatic expressions or descriptive adjectives to communicate strong feelings or vivid ideas, like saying <code>sparkling eyes</code> to describe someone's bright, lively eyes.</p>\n<p>Instead of saying <code>It seems like you have a ton of energy this morning</code>, James could say something like <code>You look energetic this morning</code> to convey the same idea. <code>Energetic</code> is the adjective to represent someone who has a lot of energy.</p>\n<p>Here are some more examples:</p>\n<p><code>She wakes up early every day</code> - <code>Early</code> describes the time of her waking up.\n<code>He has a quick shower in the morning</code> - <code>Quick</code> describes the short duration of the shower.</p>\n</section>",
