  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Indoor</code> refers to activities done inside a building, while <code>outdoor</code> means activities done outside. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Indoor activities include reading and cooking. Outdoor activities involve hiking and gardening.</code></p>\n<p><code>Though</code> is an expression you use to show contrast between two sentences, similar to <code>but</code>. It can also be used in the middle or in the end of a sentence, not only in the beginning. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I know we wanted to travel. We don't have the money for the tickets, though.</code></p>\n<p><code>I suppose</code> is used to express a mild assumption or agreement. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I suppose we could meet tomorrow.</code> (mild agreement or suggestion)</p>\n</section>",
