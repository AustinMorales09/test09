  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The modal verb <code>can</code> is used to express ability, possibility, or to ask permission. It's a versatile verb that's commonly used in everyday conversation. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I can speak three languages</code> (ability)</p>\n<p><code>Can I borrow your pen?</code> (asking permission)</p>\n<p>The word <code>tough</code> means difficult or challenging. It's often used to describe situations that require a lot of effort or endurance. For example:</p>\n<p><code>The API test was really tough</code> (indicates the test was challenging)</p>\n<p><code>They'are going through a tough time right now</code> (implies a period of difficulty)</p>\n</section>",
