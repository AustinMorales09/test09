  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Past tense verbs are used to talk about actions that happened in the past. Some verbs change their form in the past tense, like <code>say</code> to <code>said</code>. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Yesterday, she said she would join us</code> (Past tense of <code>say</code>)\n<code>He said the meeting was at noon</code> (Describes a past statement about the meeting time)</p>\n<p>Another example of irregular verb is <code>tell</code>, which becomes <code>told</code> in the past tense. For example:</p>\n<p><code>He told me about the plan last week</code> (Past tense of <code>tell</code>)\n<code>Last night, they told stories about our last project</code> (Using <code>told</code> to describe a past action)</p>\n<p>Don't worry if irregular verbs seem tricky; with practice, you'll get the hang of them!</p>\n</section>",
