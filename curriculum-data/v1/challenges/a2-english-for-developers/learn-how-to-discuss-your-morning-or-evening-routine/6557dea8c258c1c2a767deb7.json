  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>even</code> is used to add emphasis to a statement, often highlighting something surprising, unexpected, or extreme.</p>\n<p>When combined with <code>before</code> in the phrase <code>even before</code>, it emphasizes that an action or event occurs earlier than usual or expected, adding a sense of surprise or admiration. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Even before the sun rises, she starts her workout.</code> (emphasizes that her workout begins unusually early)</p>\n<p><code>He finished the project even before the deadline.</code> (implies that finishing before the deadline is surprisingly early)</p>\n<p>In conversation, using <code>even</code> can express that something is more than what might be considered normal or usual. It makes the statement stronger.</p>\n</section>",
