They show that nothing else can exceed a certain level. The general rule is:</p>\n<p>Short adjectives: create a superlative by ending <code>-est</code> at the end of the word.</p>\n<p><code>She enjoys the fullest her weekdays</code> (<code>the</code> + <code>full</code> + <code>est</code>)</p>\n<p>Long adjectives: Just add <code>the most</code> before the adjective.</p>\n<p><code>This is the most interesting book I've read.</code> (<code>the most</code> + <code>interesting</code>)</p>\n<p>This is an introduction to these adjectives. Youâ€™ll learn more in the future.</p>\n</section>",
