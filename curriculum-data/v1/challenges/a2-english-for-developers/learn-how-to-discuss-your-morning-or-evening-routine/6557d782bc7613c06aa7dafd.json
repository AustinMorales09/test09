  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>never</code> is an adverb used to mean <code>not at any time</code> or <code>not ever</code>. It's often used to talk about things that someone doesn't do or hasn't done. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I have never been to Australia.</code> (this means the person has not visited Australia at any time)\n<code>She never eats fast food.</code> (this means she does not eat fast food at any time)</p>\n<p>The word <code>thought</code> is the past tense of <code>think</code>. <code>Thought of that</code> means to have considered or come up with an idea in the past. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I thought of going to the beach, but it was too cold.</code> (this means the person considered going to the beach)</p>\n</section>",
