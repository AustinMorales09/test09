When <code>take</code> is used with different nouns, it can have special meanings. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Take a shower</code> means to shower.\n<code>Take a walk</code> means to go for a walk.\n<code>Take a nap</code> means to sleep for a little while.\n<code>Take a chance</code> means to try something that might be risky.</p>\n<p>These phrases are like fixed recipes in English; the words go together to mean something specific.</p>\n</section>",
