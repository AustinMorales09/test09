  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Sometimes, it is possible that a verb in the Simple Past and in the Present Perfect are conjugated the same way. In this dialogue, James asks if Sarah <code>has heard</code> about Quantum Computing and then says he just <code>heard</code> about it. The participle form of <code>hear</code> is <code>heard</code>, just like the past form of <code>hear</code> is <code>heard</code> as well. Examples: <code>On Monday, I heard you were coming to visit.</code> (someone told me this on Monday). <code>I have heard about the situation before.</code> (there is no reference as to when). In both cases, <code>heard</code> is used. James says he <code>just heard</code> about Quantum Computing, meaning it happened a short time ago, probably minutes before the conversation. <code>Just</code> is used here to express that something happened a bit before the moment the conversation is happening. Example: <code>I just saw him crossing the street.</code></p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
