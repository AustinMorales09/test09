  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Interior design</code> is like giving a special touch to the insides of buildings, especially your home. It's about making rooms look nice and feel comfortable. Imagine picking colors for your walls, arranging furniture in a cozy way, and adding decorations to make a room feel just right. When Tom mentions in the dialogue that you can use Augmented Reality (AR) for interior design, he means you can use technology to help imagine how furniture and colors might look in your space before actually putting them there.</p>\n</section>",
