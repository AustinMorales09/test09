  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When you say something is <code>useful</code>, you mean it can help you to perform a certain task or activity. Example: <code>Computers are very useful for calculating things.</code> As you can see, after <code>useful</code>, we have the preposition <code>for</code>, meaning any verb that comes after it has to be in the <code>-ing</code> form (see the example).</p>\n<p><code>Molecules</code> are like tiny building blocks that make up everything. Everything you see and touch is made from molecules. They are groups of two or more atoms together.</p>\n<p><code>Drugs</code> are substances that change how our bodies feel or work. There are two kinds: medicine and illegal drugs. People can take drugs as pills, liquids, or in other ways.</p>\n<p>Fill in the blanks with the correct word from the dialogue.</p>\n</section>",
