It's like your fingers have special marks that are different from everyone else's. When you use <code>fingerprint scanning</code>, the system checks these marks to make sure it's really you. Just like <code>facial recognition</code>, it is an important technique used by <code>biometrics</code>.</p>\n</section>",
