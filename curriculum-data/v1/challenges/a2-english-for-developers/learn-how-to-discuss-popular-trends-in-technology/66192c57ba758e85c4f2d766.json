  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When you say something <code>is likely to</code>, it means something is expected or probable to happen. It indicates a high chance that a particular action will occur in the future. For example, if a certain programming language is easy to use, you might say it is likely to remain popular, meaning it will probably stay popular in the future.</p>\n<p>In English, you can use verbs with the word <code>to</code> before them to talk about different actions. For example, <code>to eat</code>, <code>to run</code>, or <code>to learn</code>. When you talk about something that needs to happen or might happen in the future, you use this structure. For instance, <code>I want to eat</code>, <code>She likes to run</code>, or <code>They need to learn</code>.</p>\n<p>So, <code>to + infinitive</code> is a way you express actions that could or should occur, often indicating plans, desires, or possibilities.</p>\n</section>",
