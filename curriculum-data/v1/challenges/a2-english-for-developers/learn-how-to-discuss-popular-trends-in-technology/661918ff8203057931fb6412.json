Instead of talking on the phone, you use a special program or app on your computer, tablet, or phone. This program allows you to see and hear the other person on your screen, almost like they are in the same room with you, even if they are far away. It's a helpful tool for talking to friends, family, or colleagues when you can't meet in person.</p>\n<p>Listen and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
