She says <code>Well, it's not just for one thing.</code> In this context, <code>just</code> means the same as <code>only</code>, as in <code>it's not the only thing quantum computers can do</code>.\nIn the beginning of the dialogue, James uses <code>just</code> to say he heard about quantum computers moments before their conversation. This is another usage for <code>just</code>.</p>\n</section>",
