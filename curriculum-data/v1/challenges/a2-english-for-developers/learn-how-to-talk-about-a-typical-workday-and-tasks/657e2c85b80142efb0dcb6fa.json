  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Before</code> is used to talk about a time earlier than another event or time. It indicates that something happens first. For example, <code>I eat breakfast before I go to work</code> means that eating breakfast happens earlier in time than going to work.</p>\n<p><code>After</code> is used to describe something that happens later than another event or time. It indicates the sequence of events where something happens following something else. For example, <code>I go home after work</code> means that going home happens later in time than finishing work.</p>\n<p><code>Around</code> is used with time expressions indicates a time close to but not exactly at that point. It suggests flexibility within a short time frame. For example, <code>We'll meet around noon</code> can mean any time close to 12:00 PM, like 11:45 AM or 12:15 PM. It's commonly used to give a general idea of timing without being too specific.</p>\n</section>",
