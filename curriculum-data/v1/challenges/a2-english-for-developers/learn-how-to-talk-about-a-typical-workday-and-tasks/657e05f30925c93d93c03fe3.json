  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>AM</code> and <code>PM</code> are used to tell time during the day. <code>AM</code> means the time from midnight to noon (for example, <code>8:00 AM</code> is in the morning). <code>PM</code> means the time from noon to midnight (for example, <code>6:00 PM</code> is in the evening).</p>\n<p>In English, the day is divided into two periods using <code>AM</code> and <code>PM</code>.\n<code>AM</code> stands for <code>Ante Meridiem</code>, which is Latin for <code>before midday</code>. It refers to the time from midnight (<code>12:00 AM</code>) to noon (<code>12:00 PM</code>). So, when you say <code>9:00 AM</code>, it means 9 in the morning.</p>\n<p><code>PM</code> stands for <code>Post Meridiem</code>, which is Latin for <code>after midday</code>. It refers to the time from noon (<code>12:00 PM</code>) to just before midnight (<code>11:59 PM</code>). So, when we say <code>3:00 PM</code>, it means 3 in the afternoon.</p>\n</section>",
