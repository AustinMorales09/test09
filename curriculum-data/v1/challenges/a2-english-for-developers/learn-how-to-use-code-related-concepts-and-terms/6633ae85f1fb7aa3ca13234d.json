      {

      },
      {
        "answer": "<p>Variables and constants both need regular updates to stay effective.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This option is incorrect because constants do not change or need updates; they remain the same, unlike variables which can be updated.</p>"
      },
      {
        "answer": "<p>You can pause or play music on a radio, just as you can switch variables and constants on and off.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This isn't right because constants, unlike variables, cannot be 'switched off' or altered; they are permanent once set.</p>"
      },
      {
        "answer": "<p>Tom can only use constants during certain times of the day, while variables can be used anytime.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This statement is misleading as it suggests that the use of constants is time-restricted, which isn't true. Constants, like variables, do not have usage restrictions based on time but are defined by their unchangeable nature.</p>"
