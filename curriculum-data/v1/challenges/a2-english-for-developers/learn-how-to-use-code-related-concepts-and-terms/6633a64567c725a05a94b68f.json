  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In this task, you'll explore the metaphorical use of terms to understand programming concepts. Metaphors are a powerful way to visualize and explain complex ideas by relating them to everyday objects or actions.</p>\n<p><code>Container</code> is used metaphorically to describe variables as things that can hold and store different data, much like how a <code>container</code> can hold different items.</p>\n<p>The actions <code>fill and empty</code> describe how you can add or remove data from variables, similar to how you might <code>fill</code> a water bottle or pour the water out.</p>\n<p><code>Locked boxes</code> describes constants as secure, unchangeable <code>containers</code>, emphasizing they can't be changed once set.</p>\n<p>The phrase <code>keep the same contents</code> highlights that the data in constants does not change, like a box that is locked and always holds the same things inside.</p>\n</section>",
