  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Direct questions are straightforward inquiries that clearly ask for specific information. They typically invert the subject and the verb, like in <code>Are you sure?</code> This form is commonly used in everyday conversations, especially when quick and clear answers are needed.</p>\n<p>Indirect questions or statements, on the other hand, are more polite and less direct. They do not invert the subject and the verb and often begin with phrases like <code>I was wondering</code> or <code>Could you tell me</code>. For example, instead of asking <code>Where do you live?</code> you might say, <code>Could you tell me where you live?</code> This makes the question sound less abrupt and more polite, which is particularly useful in formal settings or when you're speaking with someone you don't know well.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>Direct question: <code>What time is it?</code> (inversion of verb <code>is</code> and subject <code>it</code>)</p>\n<p>Indirect statement: <code>Please tell me what time it is.</code> (no inversion)</p>\n</section>",
