  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>You've already learned about demonstrative pronouns like <code>this</code>, <code>that</code>, <code>these</code> and <code>those</code>. Remember to use them to refer to specific things or people, considering their proximity in time or space.</p>\n<p>The genitive case, often indicated by an apostrophe and <code>s</code> (like <code>function's</code>), is used to show possession or belonging, typically for people or objects. It tells people that something belongs to or is a part of something else.</p>\n<p>The word <code>purpose</code> refers to the reason why something is done or used, or why something exists. For example, <code>The purpose of a clock is to tell time.</code></p>\n</section>",
