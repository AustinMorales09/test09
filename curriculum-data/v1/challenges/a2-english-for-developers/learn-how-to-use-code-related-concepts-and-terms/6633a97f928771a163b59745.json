        "answer": "<p>Variables can store multiple types of data at once, whereas constants can only store one type.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This statement is misleading because it focuses on the types of data rather than how the data can be altered or remains fixed, which is the main point of Sophie's explanation.</p>"
