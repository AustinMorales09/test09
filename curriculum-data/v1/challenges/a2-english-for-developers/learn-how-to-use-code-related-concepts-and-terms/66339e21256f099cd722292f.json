They are often written in uppercase letters to distinguish them from variables.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>const PI = 3.14;</code> In many programming languages, <code>const</code> is used to declare a constant. Here, <code>PI</code> is a <code>constant</code> with assigned value <code>3.14</code>.</p>\n</section>",
