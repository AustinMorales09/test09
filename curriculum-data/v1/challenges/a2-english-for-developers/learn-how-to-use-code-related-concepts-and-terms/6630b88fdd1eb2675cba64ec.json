They can also appear at the end of a question or sentence, which is common in spoken English.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>When someone asks <code>who are you going with?</code> the preposition <code>with</code> is used at the end to inquire about the company one will have.</p>\n<p><code>What are you excited about?</code> In this question, <code>about</code> is used at the end to inquire regarding the subject or event that is causing excitement.</p>\n<p><code>Who are you waiting for?</code> Here, <code>for</code> is placed at the end of the question to ask about the person for whom someone is waiting.</p>\n</section>",
