It is used to introduce a clause providing more details about a noun.</p>\n<p>A clause is a part of a sentence that contains at least a subject and a verb. It can express a complete idea or add extra information to the main sentence.</p>\n<p>The pronoun <code>that</code> helps specify or define something more clearly, connecting it to a description or a necessary detail.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>She read the book that won the Pulitzer Prize last year.</code> In this sentence, <code>that won the Pulitzer Prize last year</code> is a relative clause introduced by <code>that</code>. The clause describes or specifies the book, helping to distinguish it from other books. Here, <code>that</code> acts as a relative pronoun connecting the clause to the noun <code>book</code>, and it describes which particular book she read.</p>\n</section>",
