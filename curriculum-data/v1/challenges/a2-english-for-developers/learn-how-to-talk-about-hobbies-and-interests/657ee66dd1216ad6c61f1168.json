  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Most</code> is used to refer to the greatest in amount or degree. For example, <code>She spends most of her time reading.</code> This means she spends the greater part of her time reading compared to other activities.</p>\n<p><code>Mostly</code>, on the other hand, means mainly or for the most part. It's used when something is true or applies to a great extent but not entirely. For instance, <code>The sky is mostly clear tonight.</code> This suggests that while there may be a few clouds, the majority of the sky is clear.</p>\n</section>",
