  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When you talk about objects or things in a specific place, you often use the word <code>that</code> to point them out. For example, <code>that shelf</code> means the shelf you are talking about or focusing on at the moment.</p>\n<p>The word <code>shelf</code> is a noun that refers to a flat, horizontal surface used for holding items. When you talk about more than one <code>shelf</code>, you should change the ending to make it plural by replacing <code>f</code> with <code>ves</code>, so it becomes <code>shelves</code>. For example, <code>one shelf</code>, <code>two shelves</code>.</p>\n</section>",
