  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In Bob's sentence, you see a different structure being introduced. Instead of saying <code>I am passionate about photography</code>, Bob uses <code>I've been passionate about  photography</code>. This has to do with the expression that comes right after, <code>for many years</code>.</p>\n<p>When you see <code>'ve been</code> in a sentence, remember it is a contraction of the verb <code>have</code>, which becomes <code>'ve</code>, and the verb <code>to be</code> in the <em>participle</em> form.</p>\n<p>For example: <code>I've been in love with Jane for a long time now, but she just likes me as a friend.</code></p>\n<p>Fill in the blanks with the correct forms of the verbs <code>have</code> and <code>be</code>, according to what Bob says.</p>\n</section>",
