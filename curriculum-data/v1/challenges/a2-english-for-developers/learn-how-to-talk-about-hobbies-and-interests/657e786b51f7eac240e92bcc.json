  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The phrase <code>would you like</code> is a polite way to offer something or ask someone if they want something. When offering something, you can specify it directly after the expression <code>would you like</code>. For instance, you might ask <code>Would you like some coffee?</code> when offering coffee to a guest.\nIf you are proposing to do something, such as <code>going shopping</code>, remember to include <code>to</code> between the expression and the action. For example: <code>Would you like to go shopping?</code>.\nFinally, if you are asking someone if you should do something for them, use <code>me</code> between <code>would you like</code> and <code>to</code>. For example: <code>Would you like me to make some coffee?</code>.</p>\n</section>",
