  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The <em>Present Perfect Tense</em> is formed using the auxiliary verb <code>have</code> or <code>has</code> with the past participle of a verb. It's used to talk about actions or situations from the past that still matter now.</p>\n<p>To form it, use <code>have</code> with <code>I</code>, <code>you</code>, <code>we</code>, <code>they</code>, and <code>has</code> with <code>he</code>, <code>she</code>, <code>it</code>. Add the past participle next.</p>\n<p>For regular verbs, it's usually the verb plus <code>-ed</code> (like <code>walked</code>), but for irregular verbs, it can vary (like <code>seen</code> from <code>see</code>). For example:</p>\n<p><code>I have walked to the park</code> or <code>She has seen the movie</code>. This tense is helpful in discussing past actions with current relevance.</p>\n</section>",
