  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The verb <code>become</code> is normally associated with transforming into something that was not the same way originally. When you say <code>I became addicted to coffee when I started working at the company</code> (<code>became</code> is the past form of <code>become</code>), you imply that you weren't addicted to coffee before joining the company, but now you are.</p>\n<p>With the <em>Present Perfect</em> tense, you use the form <code>become</code> after <code>have</code> or <code>has</code>, meaning it is a change that still influences you. For example: <code>I've become interested in video games at age 20.</code></p>\n<p>Complete the sentence with the right combination of the verbs <code>have</code> and <code>become</code>, conjugated accordingly.</p>\n</section>",
