  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In the beginning of the dialogue, Maria says <code>Are you into photography?</code> to ask if Bob likes photography. Now that she knows he does, she asks <code>How long have you been into photography?</code> to know the amount of time that has passed since he started enjoying it.</p>\n<p>Since the question is about duration from the past up until the present, you use the <em>Present Perfect</em> tense.</p>\n<p>Also, remember that the form of the verb <code>to be</code> for the Present Perfect is <code>been</code>. For example: <code>I have been in a traffic jam for an hour. I can't wait to go home.</code></p>\n<p>When you want to ask questions related to duration, start the question with <code>How long</code>. Examples: <code>How long is this movie?</code>, <code>How long have you two been married?</code></p>\n<p>Fill in the blanks with the appropriate words.</p>\n</section>",
