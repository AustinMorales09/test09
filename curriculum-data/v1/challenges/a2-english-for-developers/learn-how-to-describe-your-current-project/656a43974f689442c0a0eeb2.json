  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Currently</code> comes from <code>current</code> meaning happening now. Adding <code>-ly</code> turns an adjective into an adverb. For example:</p>\n<p><code>She is currently reading a book</code> (She is reading a book now)</p>\n<p><code>Trends</code> are popular styles or ideas that many people are talking about or doing. The word <code>trend</code> in the singular becomes <code>trends</code> in the plural. For example:</p>\n<p><code>One current trend is using eco-friendly products</code> (singular)</p>\n<p><code>She writes about fashion trends</code> (plural)</p>\n<p><code>Tech trends</code> refer to popular developments in technology.</p>\n</section>",
