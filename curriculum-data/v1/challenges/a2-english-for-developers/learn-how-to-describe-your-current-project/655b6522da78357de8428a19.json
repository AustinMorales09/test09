  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>James uses the present continuous tense to talk about actions happening at the moment of speaking or around it.</p>\n<p>The present continuous is formed with the present tense of the verb <code>to be</code> (<code>am/is/are</code>) followed by the <code>-ing</code> form of the main verb. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I am using</code> in <code>I am using special tools</code> shows an action James is currently working on.</p>\n<p>This tense is often used for actions that are temporary or in progress. Some more examples include:</p>\n<p><code>She is studying for the interview</code> (she is currently focused on studying).</p>\n<p><code>They are working on a new project</code> (they are presently involved in the project).</p>\n<p><code>He is walking to the station</code> (he is in the process of walking to the station).</p>\n</section>",
