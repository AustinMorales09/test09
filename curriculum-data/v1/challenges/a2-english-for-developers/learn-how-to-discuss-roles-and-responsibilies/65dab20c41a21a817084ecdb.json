It's a form of encouragement or praise. For example, <code>After seeing how well you organized the event, I must say, you're doing great!</code></p>\n<p>After it, you can use phrases starting with <code>verb-ing</code> that describe what the person is doing well at. For instance, <code>You're doing great keeping up with your studies.</code></p>\n<p><code>Deal with</code> means to manage or handle something, especially a problem or challenge. It involves taking action to address a situation or problem. For example, <code>She has to deal with a lot of emails every morning.</code></p>\n<p>The phrase <code>at the same time</code> indicates that two or more actions or events are happening together, not separately.</p>\n</section>",
