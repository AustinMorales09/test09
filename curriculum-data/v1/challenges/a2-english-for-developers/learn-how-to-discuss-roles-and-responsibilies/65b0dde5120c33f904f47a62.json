  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The <em>Present Perfect Tense</em> is formed with <code>have</code> or <code>has</code> plus the past participle of a verb. For example, for the irregular verb <code>meet</code>, its past participle is <code>met</code>. This tense is used to talk about experiences or actions from the past that still matter now.</p>\n<p>Use <code>have</code> with the pronouns <code>I</code>, <code>you</code>, <code>we</code>, and <code>they</code>, and use <code>has</code> with <code>he</code>, <code>she</code>, and <code>it</code>.</p>\n<p>The word <code>yet</code> is often used in questions in the Present Perfect Tense to inquire if something has happened up to now.</p>\n</section>",
