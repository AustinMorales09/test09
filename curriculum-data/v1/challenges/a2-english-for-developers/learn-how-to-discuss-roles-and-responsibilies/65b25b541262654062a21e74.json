For example, when you see a friend at a party, you <code>recognize</code> him because you know what he looks like.</p>\n<p>The phrase <code>right away</code> means quickly or very soon. For instance, <code>If you find a bug in the code, tell me and I'll fix it right away.</code> This means if you discover a problem in the computer program, let me know and I will correct it immediately.</p>\n</section>",
