For example, <code>My teacher is strict about homework deadlines.</code> It means the teacher insists that everyone hands in their homework on time.</p>\n<p><code>Fair</code> means treating everyone equally and justly. For example, <code>The judge was fair in her decision</code>, meaning the judge made a decision based on the rules and without favoritism.</p>\n<p><code>But</code> is a word used to connect two ideas that might seem opposite or different. It shows contrast. For example, <code>I like apples but not oranges.</code> This statement shows a preference for apples over oranges.</p>\n</section>",
