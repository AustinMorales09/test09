For example, <code>This book is super interesting</code> means the book is very interesting.</p>\n<p><code>Pretty</code> is used to mean \"quite\" or \"rather\". It's a way to say that something is to a large degree, but not extremely. For example, if you say <code>It's pretty cold outside</code>, you mean it's quite cold, but not extremely cold.</p>\n</section>",
