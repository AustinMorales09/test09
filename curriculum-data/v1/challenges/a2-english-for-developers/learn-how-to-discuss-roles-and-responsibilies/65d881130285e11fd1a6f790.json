It indicates that something is very important to do.</p>\n<p>The phrases <code>talk to</code> and <code>talk with</code> both refer to the act of speaking to someone, but there is a slight difference in usage. <code>Talk to</code> can imply a one-way communication, where one person is speaking and the other is listening, while <code>talk with</code> suggests a conversation where both people are equally involved in speaking and listening.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>I need to talk with my friend about our plans</code> suggests a discussion, while <code>I need to talk to my brother about his homework</code> might imply giving instructions or advice.</p>\n</section>",
