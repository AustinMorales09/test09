  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>everyone</code>  means every person in a group. <code>Every-</code> is used when talking about all things or people in a group, one by one.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that <code>everyone</code> sounds like it's talking about many people, but you use it with a singular verb. This is similar to other words starting with <code>every-</code> like <code>everything</code> and <code>everybody</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, you say <code>Everyone goes to the party</code>, <code>Everything is right</code> or <code>Everybody works hard</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Make sure</code> means to check or ensure something is correct before moving on. For example, <code>You make sure the code runs</code> means you check the code to be certain it has no errors and can run properly.</p>\n<p><code>Follow the rules</code> means to do what the rules say. If there is a rule that says <code>use camelCase for variable names</code>, to <code>follow the rules</code> means you name your variables like <code>myVariable</code> instead of <code>my_variable</code>.</p>\n</section>",
