  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The verb <code>jog</code> means to run at a slow, steady pace. The word <code>start</code> can be followed by a verb ending in <code>-ing</code> (like <code>jogging</code>) or with <code>to</code> followed by the base form of the verb (like <code>to jog</code>). This shows the beginning of an action.</p>\n<p>Adverbs describe how actions are done. They are often formed by adding <code>-ly</code> to adjectives. For example, <code>regular</code> is an adjective that means usual or done often. When you add <code>-ly</code>, it becomes <code>regularly</code>, an adverb that means doing something in a usual or frequent manner.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>He has a regular exercise schedule.</code>, or <code>He exercises regularly.</code></p>\n</section>",
