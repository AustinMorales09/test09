  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Work overtime</code> means to work more hours than the usual work schedule. For example, <code>I usually work overtime during project deadlines</code> means working extra hours to meet project deadlines.</p>\n<p><code>Unless</code> is used to talk about an exception to something or introduce a condition that makes the previous statement not true. It means <code>if it's not the case</code>. For example, <code>I walk to work unless it rains</code> means I walk to work if it doesn't rain.</p>\n<p><code>Urgent</code> means something that is very important and needs immediate attention. For example, <code>The project is urgent</code> means the project needs to be completed right away.</p>\n<p>In a negative sentence, <code>don't/doesn't have to</code> expresses that something is not a requirement. For example, <code>I don't have to work late</code> means working late is not required.</p>\n</section>",
