  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>easygoing</code> describes someone who is relaxed and not easily upset or worried. An <code>easygoing</code> person is comfortable to be around because they do not get stressed or angry easily. For example, <code>My team leader is very easygoing, which makes working on projects less stressful.</code></p>\n<p>The word <code>actually</code> is used to add new, often surprising information or to correct something. For example, <code>I thought the test was next week, but it's actually tomorrow.</code> Here, <code>actually</code> shows that the real test date is surprising or different from what I thought.</p>\n</section>",
