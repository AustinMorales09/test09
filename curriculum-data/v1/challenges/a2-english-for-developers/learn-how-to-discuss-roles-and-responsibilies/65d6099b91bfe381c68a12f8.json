  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>seriously</code> is an adverb that means doing something with a lot of thought and attention, showing that it's important to you. It's the adverb form of the adjective <code>serious</code>.</p>\n<p>For example, when <code>someone is serious about a project</code>, they think it's very important. If <code>they work seriously</code>, it means they work with a lot of effort and care.</p>\n<p>To make an adverb from an adjective, you often add <code>-ly</code> to the end of the adjective. When an adjective ends in <code>y</code>, you need to change the <code>y</code> to <code>i</code> and add <code>-ly</code>. For instance, <code>happy</code> becomes <code>happily</code>.</p>\n</section>",
