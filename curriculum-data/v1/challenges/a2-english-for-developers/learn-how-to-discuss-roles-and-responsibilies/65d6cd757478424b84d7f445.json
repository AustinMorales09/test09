  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Fair</code> means treating people equally and making decisions that are right and just. For example, <code>The teacher is fair when grading tests</code> means the teacher treats all students the same way when marking their work.</p>\n<p><code>Supportive</code> is an adjective which describes someone who gives help and encouragement. It comes from the verb <code>support</code>, which means to give help or assistance to someone or something.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>My coach is very supportive during training</code> means the coach helps and encourages the team a lot.</p>\n<p><code>My friends support me when I have problems</code> means your friends help and encourage you during difficult times.</p>\n<p><code>Be willing to</code> means being ready and not hesitant to do something. After <code>be willing to</code>, you use a base verb to describe the action someone is ready to take. For instance, <code>He is willing to learn new programming languages</code> means he is open and ready to start learning new languages.</p>\n</section>",
