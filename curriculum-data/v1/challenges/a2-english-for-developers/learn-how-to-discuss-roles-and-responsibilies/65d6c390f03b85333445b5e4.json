  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The phrase <code>have to</code> is used to talk about things that are necessary or required. It is similar to <code>must</code>, but <code>must</code> is stronger and used for more important rules or personal feelings.</p>\n<p>After <code>have to</code>, you use a base verb to explain what action is necessary. For example, <code>You have to wear a helmet</code> means wearing a helmet is necessary for safety.</p>\n<p><code>Though</code> is a word used to show a small contrast or surprise in a sentence. It's similar to <code>but</code>. For example, <code>It's cold, though it's sunny</code> means it's surprising the weather is cold because it's also sunny.</p>\n</section>",
