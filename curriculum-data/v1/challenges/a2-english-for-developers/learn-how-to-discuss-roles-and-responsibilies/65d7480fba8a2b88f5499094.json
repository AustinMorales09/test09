  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>must</code> is used to express a strong necessity or obligation. It is followed by a verb to show something that is very important or necessary to do.</p>\n<p>It's similar to <code>have to</code>, but <code>must</code> is often used when the obligation comes from the speaker or is internal, while <code>have to</code> is often used for external obligations or rules.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>You must study for the test</code> means the speaker thinks it's very important for you to study for the test.</p>\n<p><code>I have to go to work at 8 AM</code> means the speaker needs to work at 8 AM because of a job schedule.</p>\n<p><code>Talk with</code> means to have a conversation or discussion with someone. For example, <code>I need to talk with my teacher about the homework</code> means I need to have a conversation with my teacher concerning the homework.</p>\n</section>",
