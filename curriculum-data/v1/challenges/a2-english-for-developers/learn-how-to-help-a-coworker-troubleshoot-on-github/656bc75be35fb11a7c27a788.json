It's a casual and quick way to acknowledge that you have received and comprehended the information. For example:</p>\n<p>Lucy: <code>You need to finish the report by tomorrow.</code>\nBob: <code>Got it!</code></p>\n<p><code>Got it</code> means that Bob understands the instruction.</p>\n</section>",
