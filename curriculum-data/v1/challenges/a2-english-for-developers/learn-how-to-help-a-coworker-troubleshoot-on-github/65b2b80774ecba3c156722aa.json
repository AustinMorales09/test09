For example, <code>I ran into my friend at the store</code> means you met your friend without planning to.</p>\n<p>The expression <code>run into the same problem</code> specifically refers to facing the same difficulty or issue again. It's a way to talk about facing a repeated challenge, especially one that you have experienced before and want to avoid.</p>\n<p>For example, if a software crashes due to a specific bug, and you fix it, you would document the solution to ensure you don't <code>run into the same problem</code> in the future.</p>\n</section>",
