  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Imagine you're working on a project and have been trying different solutions over time. To express this ongoing effort, you can use the present perfect tense. This tense connects past actions to the present moment.</p>\n<p>The present perfect tense is formed using the auxiliary verb <code>have</code> or <code>has</code> followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example, <code>I have been working on this for a long time</code> or <code>he has worked on this for a long time</code>.</p>\n<p>Let's practice using the present perfect tense to talk about actions that started in the past and are still relevant now.</p>\n</section>",
