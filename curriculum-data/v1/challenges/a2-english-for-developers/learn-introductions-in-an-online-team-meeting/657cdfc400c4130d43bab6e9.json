  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>All of you</code> is a phrase used to include every person in a group. For example, <code>I want to thank all of you for coming</code> means thanking every person who came.</p>\n<p>The word <code>your</code> can refer to something that belongs to either an individual or a group, depending on the context.</p>\n<p>When talking to one person, <code>your</code> refers to something belonging to that individual. For example, <code>Your book is on the table</code> means the book belongs to the individual you're speaking to.</p>\n<p>In contrast, when speaking to a group, <code>your</code> can refer to something that belongs to all of them. For example, <code>Your project is impressive</code> means the project belonging to the entire group is impressive. Understanding the context helps to determine if <code>your</code> is singular or plural.</p>\n</section>",
