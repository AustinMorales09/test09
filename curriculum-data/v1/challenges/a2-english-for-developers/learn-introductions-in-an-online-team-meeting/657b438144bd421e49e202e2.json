  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In English, many professions are named by adding <code>er</code> to the end of a word that describes what the person does.</p>\n<p>For example, a <code>programmer</code> is someone who <code>programs</code>, a <code>developer</code> is someone who <code>develops</code> software or systems. Another example is a <code>designer</code>, who is a person that <code>designs</code> websites, graphics, or products.</p>\n<p>By adding <code>er</code> to a verb, you create a noun that describes a person's job. It doesnÂ´t apply to all professions but you'll see this pattern in many.</p>\n</section>",
