  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>He's</code> can be a short form for <code>he has</code> or <code>he is</code>. You can understand which one it is by looking at the context. When <code>he's</code> is followed by a verb in the past participle (like <code>been</code>, <code>done</code>, <code>seen</code>), it means <code>he has</code>. For example:</p>\n<p><code>He's been working</code> means <code>he has been working</code>.</p>\n<p>If <code>he's</code> is followed by an adjective or a present participle (like <code>tired</code>, <code>going</code>, <code>sleeping</code>), it means <code>he is</code>. For example:</p>\n<p><code>He's tired</code> means <code>he is tired</code>. Understanding this helps you know exactly what someone means when they say <code>he's</code>.</p>\n</section>",
