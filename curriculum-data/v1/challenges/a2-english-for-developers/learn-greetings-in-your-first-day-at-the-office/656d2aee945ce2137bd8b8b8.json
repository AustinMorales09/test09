The term <code>lock</code> refers to securing something, usually a door or a container, so that it cannot be opened without the correct key or combination. For example, you might lock your house when you leave to keep it safe.</p>\n<p><code>Unlock</code> means to open a lock, allowing access. In some places, when a door is unlocked, it might make a <code>click</code> sound as an indicator.</p>\n</section>",
