  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In English, we use names to directly refer to specific people. See this example:</p>\n<p><code>Hello! You're Amy, correct?</code></p>\n<p>In English, names directly refer to specific people. Saying <code>Amy</code> identifies a particular person with that name. Using <code>the</code> or <code>an</code> before a name, like <code>the Amy</code> or <code>an Amy</code>, sounds unusual because names are already unique and specific.</p>\n<p>Think of names as unique labels for people. So, you don't need <code>a</code>, <code>an</code>, or <code>the</code> before a person's name. Just use the name by itself!</p>\n</section>",
