Pronouns are useful to avoid repetition and make sentences clearer.</p>\n<p>Notice this part of the dialogue:</p>\n<p><code>Tom, this is Brian. He's a web developer. Brian, this is Tom. He's our new graphic designer and he is from Texas.</code></p>\n<p>In the dialogue, after introducing Brian, Sophie uses <code>he</code> to talk about Brian's job. Later, she uses <code>he</code> again to talk about Tom and his job.</p>\n<p>By using <code>he</code>, Sophie doesn't have to repeat the names <code>Brian</code> and <code>Tom</code>. This is the power of the pronouns.</p>\n</section>",
