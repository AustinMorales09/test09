  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Most</code> is an adjective you can use when to talk about the biggest part of something. For exmaple:</p>\n<p><code>We completed most of our work before lunch,</code> it means a group finished the biggest part of their work.</p>\n<p><code>Mostly</code> is an adverb. You use it to talk about what something is like most of the time. For exemple:</p>\n<p><code>The office is mostly quiet in the mornings,</code> means that usually, in the mornings, the office is quiet.</p>\n<p>So, <code>most</code> talks about a big part of something, and <code>mostly</code> tells you what usually happens or what something is like most of the time.</p>\n</section>",
