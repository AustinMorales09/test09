The verb <code>to be</code>is one of them.</p>\n<p>If you want to create a negative sentence using the verb <code>to be</code> in the past, simply  add <code>not</code> after <code>was</code> or <code>were</code>. For example:</p>\n<p><code>It was working normally</code> -> <code>It wasn't working normally</code>.</p>\n<p><code>They were informed earlier</code> -> <code>They weren't informed earlier</code>.</p>\n<p><code>Wasn't</code> is the abbreviation of <code>was not</code> and <code>weren't</code> the abbreviation of <code>were not</code>.</p>\n</section>",
