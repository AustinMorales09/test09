  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The rule for conjugating verbs in the past tense that end with <code>y</code> depends on the letter before the <code>y</code>. Here's how it works:</p>\n<p>If the verb ends with a <strong>vowel followed by <code>y</code></strong> simply add <code>-ed</code> to the end of the verb. For example: <code>Stay</code> becomes <code>stayed</code>.</p>\n<p>If the verb ends with a <strong>consonant followed by <code>y</code></strong>, change the <code>y</code> to <code>i</code> and add <code>-ed</code>. For example: <code>study</code> becomes <code>studied</code>.</p>\n</section>",
