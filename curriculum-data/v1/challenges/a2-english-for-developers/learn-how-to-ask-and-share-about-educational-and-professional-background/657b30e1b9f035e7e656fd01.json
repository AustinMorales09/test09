Talking about <code>employees' well-being</code> means you're discussing the health and happiness of the people working at a place. The <code>'</code> after <code>employees</code> shows that the well-being belongs to them. For exemple:</p>\n<p><code>The project's code</code>, means the code belongs to one project. If you're talking about several projects and say <code>the projects' code</code>, it means the code belongs to more than one project.</p>\n</section>",
