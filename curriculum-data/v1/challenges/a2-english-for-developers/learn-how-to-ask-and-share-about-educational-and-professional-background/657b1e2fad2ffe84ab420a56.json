  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>For most verbs, if you want to make a negative sentence in the past tense, simply put <code>didn't</code> in front of the main verb.\n<code>Didn't</code> is short for <code>did not</code>.</p>\n<p>Remember that the main verb stays in its simple form. Only the auxiliary verb <code>did</code> is conjugated. For example:</p>\n<p><strong>Affirmative sentence in the past</strong>: <code>I worked yesterday</code> - The Verb <code>work</code> is conjugated to the past.</p>\n<p><strong>Negative sentence in the past</strong>: <code>I didn't work yesterday</code> - Only the auxiliary verb is conjugated to the past.</p>\n</section>",
