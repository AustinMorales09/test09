  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>In this task, you'll learn about the word <code>actual</code>. It's an adjective, which is a type of word that describes something. When you say <code>actual</code>, you're talking about what something is really like. For instance, when you talk about <code>the actual color</code>, you mean the real color of something.</p>\n<p>Often, you can add <code>-ly</code> to an adjective to make it an adverb. Adverbs are words that tell us how something is said or done. So, when you add <code>-ly</code> to <code>actual</code>, you get <code>actually</code>, which is an adverb.</p>\n<p>Read the sentence below and place the words <code>actual</code>and <code>actually</code> in the correct place.</p>\n</section>",
