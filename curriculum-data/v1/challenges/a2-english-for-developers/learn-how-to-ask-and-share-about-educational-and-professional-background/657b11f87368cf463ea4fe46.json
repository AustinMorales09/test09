  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Questions in the past tense with the verb <code>to be</code> are very similar to how you do it in the present tense. The only difference is that you need to remember to conjugate the verb to <code>were</code> or <code>was</code>, followed by the subject and then the main verb. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Were you at the meeting yesterday?</code> Notice how <code>were</code> comes before <code>you</code> to for a question.\n<code>What was my assignment?</code> For a specific question, notice how <code>was</code> comes after <code>what</code> and before <code>my</code>.</p>\n</section>",
