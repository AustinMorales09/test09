      {
        "answer": "<p>Object-oriented programming is about creating a sequence of commands that the computer follows one after another.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This statement describes procedural programming, not object-oriented programming which focuses on classes and objects.</p>"

      {
        "answer": "<p>Object-oriented programming primarily involves using standard templates for web development.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This option incorrectly describes object-oriented programming as it does not mention the creation and interaction of objects, which are central to OOP.</p>"
      },
      {
        "answer": "<p>Object-oriented programming uses classes as blueprints to create objects, and methods within these classes define what actions the objects can perform.</p>",

      {
        "answer": "<p>Object-oriented programming is a simple method that involves copying existing codes into new programs.</p>",
        "feedback": "<p>This description is incorrect as object-oriented programming is not about copying code but designing systems through objects and classes.</p>"
