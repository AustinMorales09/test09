  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Object-oriented programming</code> (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of <code>objects</code>, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>\n<p>A common example of <code>OOP</code> is creating a class in a programming language like Java or Python. This class defines the structure of objects, including their attributes and methods. For instance, a <code>Car</code> class might include attributes like <code>color</code> and <code>model</code>, and methods like <code>drive()</code> and <code>brake()</code>.</p>\n<p>The term <code>oriented</code> in this context means aligned or directed towards a particular purpose or principle.</p>\n<p>For example, freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum is described as <code>project-oriented</code> because it is structured around completing projects, which means the teaching method is focused on practical application rather than just theoretical knowledge.</p>\n</section>",
