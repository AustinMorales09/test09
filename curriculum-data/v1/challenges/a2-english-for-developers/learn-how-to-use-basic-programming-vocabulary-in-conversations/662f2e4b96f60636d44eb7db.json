  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>A <code>class</code> is a fundamental concept, especially in object-oriented programming. It acts like a blueprint for creating objects. A <code>class</code> defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (<code>methods</code>) that the objects created from the <code>class</code> can have.</p>\n<p>For example, a <code>Person</code> class might have properties like <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>, and behaviors like <code>talk()</code> and <code>walk()</code>.</p>\n<p>A <code>method</code> is a function that is associated with an object. <code>Methods</code> define the behaviors or actions that an object created from a <code>class</code> can perform. They are like instructions that tell the object what to do.</p>\n<p>For instance, in a <code>Calculator class</code>, a <code>method</code> might be <code>add(number1, number2)</code>, which adds two numbers together.</p>\n</section>",
