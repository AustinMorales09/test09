  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Learn <code>variables</code>, <code>data types</code> and <code>conditional statements</code> in programming.</p>\n<p>A <code>variable</code> is like a box where you can store information. This information can be numbers, text, or other types of data. You can change what's in the box, which is why it's called a <code>variable</code> â€“ because it can vary. For example, in <code>x = 5</code>, <code>x</code> temporarily holds the value 5.</p>\n<p>A <code>data type</code> is a classification that specifies the type of data that a <code>variable</code> can hold. Common <code>data types</code> include integers (whole numbers), floats (numbers with a decimal), strings (text), and booleans (true or false). For example, if <code>age = 21</code>, the <code>data type</code> is an integer.</p>\n<p>A <code>conditional statement</code> is a command that tells the computer to do something only if a specific condition is true. It's like making a decision in real life based on a certain situation. Common <code>conditional statements</code> are <code>if-else</code> statements. For example, <code>if (temperature > 20) {console.log(\"It's warm outside!\");}</code> is a <code>conditional statement</code> that executes <code>{console.log(\"It's warm outside!\")</code> if the temperature is above 20 degrees.</p>\n</section>",
