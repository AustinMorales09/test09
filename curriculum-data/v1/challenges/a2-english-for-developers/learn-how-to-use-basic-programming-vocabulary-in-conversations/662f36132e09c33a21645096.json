In various contexts, it can mean that a person or thing is actively engaged in something or that a situation requires something as a part of the process.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>The job involves using computers every day.</code> This means using computers is a necessary part of the job.</p>\n<p>The term <code>blueprint</code> originally refers to a detailed technical drawing or plan for building something. In a broader sense, and especially in programming, a <code>blueprint</code> is a guide or a model that shows how to construct or design something.</p>\n</section>",
