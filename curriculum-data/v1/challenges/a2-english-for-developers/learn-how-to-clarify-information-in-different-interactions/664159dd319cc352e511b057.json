For example, if a bag of apples weighs <code>2 pounds</code> (for those who use the metric system, approximately 1 <code>kilogram</code>), it means the apples are as heavy as that.</p>\n<p><code>Chicken wings</code> are a type of food made from the wings of a chicken. They are often cooked and eaten as a snack or meal, sometimes with sauce or seasoning.</p>\n<p><code>To agree on something</code> means that two or more people share the same opinion or decision about a specific thing. For example, if you and your friend both decide to go to the movies, you can say <code>I agree on going to the movies</code> to tell your friend you like the plan or idea.</p>\n</section>",
