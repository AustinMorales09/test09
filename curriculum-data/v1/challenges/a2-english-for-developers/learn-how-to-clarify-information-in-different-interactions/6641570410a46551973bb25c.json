  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The verb <code>to think</code>, in English, is irregular. Different from other, regular verbs, which get <code>-ed</code> added to them to form the past, when you want to use the verb <code>think</code> in the past, you use the word <code>thought</code>. Example: <code>I thought you were out of town</code>, meaning you imagined that the other person traveled to some other place.</p>\n<p>The question <code>What happened?</code> indicates you are asking someone to explain an event or situation. For example, if you see someone looking upset, you might ask, <code>What happened?</code> to understand why they are upset. It means you want to know what made the other person upset. If you see someone with an arm or a leg in a cast, you can ask <code>What happened?</code> to understand how the person got hurt.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
