  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>It's important to make a distinction between actions described in the <code>Simple Present</code> tense and those described in the <code>Present Continuous</code> tense. If you say <code>I work as a developer</code> (<code>Simple Present</code>), you want to inform the other person that this is your occupation. If you say <code>I am working on a project</code> (<code>Present Continuous</code>), you are informing the person what your current task or activity is.</p>\n<p>In a question, you make this distinction by asking <code>What do you do?</code> (<code>Simple Present</code>, used to ask about a person's career or occupation) or <code>What are you doing?</code> (<code>Present Continuous</code>, used to ask about the other person's current activity). When referring to another person, use <code>What does he/she do?</code> or <code>What do they do?</code> (more general and avoids determining a gender to the other person) to know about another person's job and <code>What is he/she doing?</code> or <code>What are they doing?</code> to know about another person's activity at the moment.</p>\n</section>",
