For example, if you forgot where you put your keys but then remember, you might say, <code>Now that I think about it, they are on the table.</code> It means you have thought again and found new information.</p>\n<p><code>To confuse something with something else</code> means to mix up two things and think one is the other. For example, if you see someoneâ€™s twin and think it is your friend, you can say <code>Sorry. I confused your twin with you</code>. It means you mistake one thing for another.</p>\n</section>",
