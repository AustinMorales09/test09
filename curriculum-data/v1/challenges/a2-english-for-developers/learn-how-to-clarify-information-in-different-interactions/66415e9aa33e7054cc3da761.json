For example, a <code>family gathering</code> is when family members meet to spend time together. It means a group of people meeting in one place.</p>\n<p>Just as in the phrase <code>I'm sure</code>, asking <code>Are you sure?</code> means you are asking someone if they are really confident that something is true. For example, if your friend says the store is open and you want to be certain, you may ask, <code>Are you sure?</code> It means you want to know if they are confident and have no doubt about it.</p>\n</section>",
