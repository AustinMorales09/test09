For example, if someone doesn't understand your instructions, you can say <code>Let me try to clarify the instructions for you</code>. This means you will try to explain them in a simpler way.</p>\n<p><code>Outdated</code> means something is old and not useful anymore. For example, if you have an old phone that can't run new apps, it is <code>outdated</code>. It's the opposite of <code>updated</code>, which is when something has the most current information available.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
