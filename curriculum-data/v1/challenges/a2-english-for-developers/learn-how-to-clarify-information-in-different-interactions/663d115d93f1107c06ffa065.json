  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Previously, you saw that, in order to talk about something that is happening at the moment you are speaking, you can use the <code>Present Continuous</code> tense (verb <code>to be</code> + a verb in the <code>-ing</code> form). It is possible, however, to use the same structure to talk about future events that are already part of a schedule. Example: If a doctor says <code>I am seeing a patient at 4.</code>, they mean there is a patient scheduled to see them at that time. The event will happen in the future, but it is possible to use the <code>Present Continuous</code> tense to express it.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
