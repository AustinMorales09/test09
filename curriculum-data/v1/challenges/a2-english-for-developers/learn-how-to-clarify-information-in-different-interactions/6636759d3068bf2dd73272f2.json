  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When talking about a person's clothes, it is common to refer to them by mentioning their size and color. Let's take a look at some colors in this challenge.</p>\n<p><code>Beige</code> is a color similar that of sand on a tropical beach or a very light brown paper.</p>\n<p><code>Black</code> is the darkest color. It looks like the sky at night when it's very dark and there are no lights. You can also hear people refer to <code>black</code> as the absence of colors. It is the opposite of <code>white</code>, which is referred to as the combination of all colors.</p>\n<p><code>Green</code> is the color of many plants and leaves. It looks like the color of grass in a park or the leaves on trees.</p>\n<p>Listen to the audio and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
