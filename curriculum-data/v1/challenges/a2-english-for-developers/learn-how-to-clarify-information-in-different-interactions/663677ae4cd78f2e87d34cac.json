  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Now it's time to introduce some pieces of clothing in English. In this lesson, Tom mentions two pieces that you normally wear on the upper part of your body.</p>\n<p>A <code>jacket</code> is a piece of clothing you wear over your other clothes to keep warm or dry. It usually has long sleeves and a zipper or buttons in the front.</p>\n<p>A <code>shirt</code> is a piece of clothing that covers your upper body. It can have short or long sleeves and usually buttons or a collar. You wear it under a jacket or on its own. Do not confuse it with a <code>T-shirt</code>, which is normally more informal and has no buttons on.</p>\n</section>",
