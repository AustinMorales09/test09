For example, if you see a big, beautiful rainbow, you might say, <code>Whoa!</code> to show you are impressed. It can also be used to tell someone to stop or slow down.</p>\n<p>When you say something is <code>a mouthful</code>, you mean that something (like a word or sentence) is long or difficult to say. For example, if a word or name has many letters and sounds, you can say <code>it's a mouthful</code>. It means it is hard to say it all at once.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
