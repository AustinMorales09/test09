  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When using words like <code>everybody</code> or <code>everyone</code>, which mean all the people in a group, we treat them as if they are one person. This is why we use 3rd person singular verbs with them. For example, you say, <code>Everybody IS here</code> (instead of <code>are</code>) or <code>Everyone LIKES ice cream</code> (instead of <code>like</code>). Even though these words refer to many people, the verb form used is the same as for one person, like <code>he</code> or <code>she</code>.</p>\n<p>Listen to Bob and fill in the blank.</p>\n</section>",
