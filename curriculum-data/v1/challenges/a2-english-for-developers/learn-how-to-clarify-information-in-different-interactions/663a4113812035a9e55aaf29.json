For example, you might describe your favorite toy by saying what color it is and what shapes it has. If the description is of someone, then you talk about physical characteristics, distinctive features or even about what the person is wearing at that moment.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
