For example, you can say <code>I wanted to make sure the door is locked</code>, when you check the lock to confirm it is secure.</p>\n<p><code>Choices</code> are the different options you can pick from. For example, if you are choosing a flavor of ice cream, the <code>choices</code> might be chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. It means you have more than one possibility to select from.</p>\n<p>Listen to Bob and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
