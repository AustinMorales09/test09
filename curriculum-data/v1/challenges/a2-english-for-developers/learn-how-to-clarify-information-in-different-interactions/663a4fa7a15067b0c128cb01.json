  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>When using the third person singular (<code>he</code>, <code>she</code>, or <code>it</code>) in the <code>Simple Present</code> tense, you normally add an <code>-s</code> to the end of a verb. For example, <code>he wears glasses</code>. However, when using the negative form, the <code>-s</code> goes to the auxiliary verb <code>do</code> and gets an extra <code>e</code>, forming <code>does</code>, combined with <code>not</code> and the verb in the regular form. Example: <code>he does not wear glasses</code>.</p>\n<p>One typical characteristic used to describe a person is to mention that they normally have or don't have their glasses on.</p>\n<p>Listen to Sophie's description of Tom and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>",
