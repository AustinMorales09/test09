  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><code>Double check</code> means to look at something again to make sure it is correct. For example, you can say <code>I wanted to be sure I locked the door, so I double checked it</code>. It means you are being careful to avoid mistakes, so you are checking what you did again.</p>\n<p>A <code>schedule</code> is a plan that shows when things will happen. For example, a <code>school schedule</code> shows what time classes start and end. It helps you know what to do at different times of the day. In a project, you could use it to estimate the days certain parts of the project start and end.</p>\n<p><code>Accurate</code> means something is correct and has no mistakes. For example, if a clock shows the right time, it is <code>accurate</code>. It means the information is true and exact.</p>\n</section>",
