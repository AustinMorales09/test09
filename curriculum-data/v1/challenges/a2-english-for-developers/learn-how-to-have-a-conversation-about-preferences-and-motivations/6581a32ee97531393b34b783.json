For example, when your friend says, <code>You can solve this coding problem!</code> they are encouraging you.</p>\n<p><code>Discourage</code> is the opposite; it means to make someone feel less confident or less likely to do something. If that friend says, <code>That programming language is too hard for beginners,</code> it might discourage you from learning it.</p>\n<p><code>Discouraging</code> describes something that makes you feel discouraged. Like, <code>Finding a bug in your code after hours of work can be discouraging.</code></p>\n<p><code>Encouraging</code> is when something gives you courage or hope. For example, <code>Getting your first program to run is very encouraging.</code></p>\n</section>",
