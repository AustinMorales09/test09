  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Comparatives are used to compare two things or people. For short adjectives, typically those with one or two syllables, you add <code>-er</code> to the end of the word, like <code>tall</code> becomes <code>taller</code> and <code>small</code> becomes <code>smaller</code>. For words which end in <code>-y</code>, you change the <code>y</code> to <code>i</code> and add <code>-er</code>, like <code>happy</code> becomes <code>happier</code>.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>He is taller than his brother.</code> - <code>Taller</code> is the comparative form of <code>tall</code>, used because the speaker is comparing the height of two people.</p>\n<p><code>This box is smaller than that one.</code> - <code>Smaller</code> is the comparative form of <code>small</code>, used to compare the size of two boxes.</p>\n</section>",
