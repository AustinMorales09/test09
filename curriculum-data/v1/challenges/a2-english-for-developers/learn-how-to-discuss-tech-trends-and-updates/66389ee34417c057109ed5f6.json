In programming, it might involve using software to write code, test applications, or find and fix errors. For example, a coffee machine that turns on by itself in the morning to make coffee is <code>automated</code>.</p>\n<p>The word <code>certain</code> is used to talk about specific things or people, but not all things or people. For instance, if you say <code>certain books are on sale</code>, it means only some books are on sale, not all of them.</p>\n</section>",
