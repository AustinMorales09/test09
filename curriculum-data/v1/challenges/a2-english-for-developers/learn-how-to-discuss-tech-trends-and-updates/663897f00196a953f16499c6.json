It helps indicate that the quantity or existence is uncertain or general.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>Do you have any questions?</code> - <code>Any</code> is used in a question to ask if there are questions, even one.</p>\n<p><code>I don't have any money.</code> - In this negative sentence, <code>any</code> shows that the speaker has zero money.</p>\n<p>Understanding how to use <code>any</code> correctly is important for forming clear and accurate questions and negative statements. On the other hand, <code>some</code> is often used in affirmative statements to indicate an unspecified amount or number.</p>\n</section>",
