  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The term <code>run code</code> refers to the action of executing or operating a program or script by a computer. To <code>run</code> in this context means to start the process and see it through until the program does what it's designed to do, whether it's calculating numbers, sorting data, or anything else.</p>\n<p>The phrase <code>run code without managing servers</code> refers to executing computer programs or applications without the need to handle the physical or virtual servers on which the code runs. This is a key aspect of serverless computing, where the cloud provider manages the servers, allowing developers to focus more on coding than on server management.</p>\n</section>",
