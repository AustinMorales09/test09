  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The phrase <code>why don't</code> is often used to make a suggestion or offer. It is followed by a subject (like <code>we</code>, <code>you</code>, or <code>they</code>) and a base verb. The structure is <code>why don't + subject + base verb</code>. It's a polite way of suggesting an action or asking someone to do something.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>Why don't we go to the cinema tonight?</code> The speaker suggests going to the cinema.</p>\n<p><code>Why don't you try restarting the computer?</code> The speaker suggests restarting the computer as a solution.</p>\n<p>The phrase <code>check out</code> means to examine or look at something more closely, commonly used when suggesting to explore or learn more about something. For instance, <code>Let's check out the new restaurant</code> implies visiting and trying the restaurant.</p>\n</section>",
