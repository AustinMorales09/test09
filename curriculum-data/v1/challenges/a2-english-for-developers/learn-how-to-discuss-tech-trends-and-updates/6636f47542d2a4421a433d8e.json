This structure helps compare qualities or characteristics of different items or people.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><code>This book is more interesting than the one I read last week.</code> <code>More interesting</code> is the comparative form of <code>interesting</code>, used to compare the level of interest between two books.</p>\n<p><code>He is less experienced than his colleague.</code> <code>Less experienced</code> is the comparative form of <code>experienced</code>, used to compare the amount of experience between two individuals.</p>\n</section>",
