The modal verb <code>could</code> is used here to express possibility or potential, implying that the action is not certain but is one option to consider.</p>\n<p>For example, saying <code>Maybe we could go to the cinema tonight</code> suggests that going to the cinema is one possibility among others, depending on other factors like availability or interest.</p>\n</section>",
