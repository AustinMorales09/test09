It's a technique used to find errors, improve code quality, and ensure that coding standards are met. <code>Code analysis</code> can be done manually by programmers or automatically using tools.</p>\n<p><code>Bug detection</code> in programming refers to the process of identifying and fixing bugs or errors in the code. Bugs can cause a program to crash, produce incorrect results, or behave unpredictably. Effective <code>bug detection</code> is crucial for creating reliable and efficient software. Tools and methods like automated testing, code reviews, and using AI for analysis can greatly assist in this process.</p>\n</section>",
