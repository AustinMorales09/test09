  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>The word <code>especially</code> is used to emphasize one person or thing over all others. It's often used to indicate that something applies more strongly to one item compared to others. For example, <code>I like many sports, especially basketball.</code> This indicates a particular preference for basketball over other sports.</p>\n<p><code>Especially useful</code> points to something being of great help in specific contexts. For instance, A multi-tool is <code>especially useful</code> for camping, as it provides various functions beneficial for outdoor activities, proving to be more useful than carrying separate tools.</p>\n</section>",
