Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can keep my polls and come back later to access them.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can share my polls with my friends.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can see the aggregate results of my polls.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can create a poll with any number of possible items.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see and vote on everyone's polls.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, if you don't like the options on a poll, you can create a new option.</p>\n<p>When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.</p>\n</section>",
