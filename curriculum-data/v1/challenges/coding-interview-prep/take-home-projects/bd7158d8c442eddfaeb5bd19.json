You can use Wikipedia as your data source.</p>\n<p>Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
