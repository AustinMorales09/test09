Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can link to images.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.</p>\n<p>Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
