  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see the weather in my current location.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (<code>https://</code>) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API <a href=\"https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">CodePen.io</a> via <code>https://</code>.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
