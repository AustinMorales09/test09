  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href=\"https://p2p-video-chat-application.freecodecamp.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://p2p-video-chat-application.freecodecamp.rocks/</a>.</p>\n<p>Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Upon arriving, the browser will prompt me to access my camera and microphone.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> After I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Once I type in the room name, a room will be created if no room of that name existed before.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> A friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video chat with me.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I type in a room name, and there are already two people in that room, I get a notification that the room is full.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Anyone can create or join any room. And there can be any number of rooms, but all of them must have unique names.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can choose to not permit the site to access my microphone and webcam. If I choose not to do this, or if some other driver problem occurs, I see an error message saying these are required.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> When I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no name, or just spaces, it should again ask me again to type in a valid room name.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.</p>\n<p>Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
