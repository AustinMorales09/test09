  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE</a>.</p>\n<p>Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I am presented with a random series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Here are mp3s you can use for each button: <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound1.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound2.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound3.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound4.mp3</code>.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
