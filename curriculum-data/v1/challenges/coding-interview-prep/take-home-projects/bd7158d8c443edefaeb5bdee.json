Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can get the image URLs, description and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can paginate through the responses by adding a <code>?page=2</code> parameter to the URL.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.</p>\n<p>When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.</p>\n</section>",
