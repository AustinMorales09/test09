Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, you can view all bars in your area.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can add yourself to a bar to indicate you are going there tonight.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can remove yourself from a bar if you no longer want to go there.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, when you login you should not have to search again.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.</p>\n<p>When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.</p>\n</section>",
