Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can add new stocks by their symbol name.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can remove stocks.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> You can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.</p>\n<p>When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.</p>\n</section>",
