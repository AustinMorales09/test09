Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can click into any of those recipes to view it.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can edit these recipes.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can delete these recipes.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. <code>_username_recipes</code></p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>",
