  "instructions": "<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Passwords should never be stored in plain text. They should be stored as hashes, just in case the password list is discovered. However, not all hashes are created equal.</p>\n<p>For this project you will learn about the importance of good security by creating a password cracker to figure out passwords that were hashed using SHA-1.</p>\n<p>Create a function that takes in a SHA-1 hash of a password and returns the password if it is one of the top 10,000 passwords used. If the SHA-1 hash is NOT of a password in the database, return \"PASSWORD NOT IN DATABASE\".</p>\n<p>The function should hash each password from <code>top-10000-passwords.txt</code> and compare it to the hash passed into the function.</p>\n<p>The function should take an optional second argument named <code>use_salts</code>. If set to true, each salt string from the file <code>known-salts.txt</code> should be appended AND prepended to each password from <code>top-10000-passwords.txt</code> before hashing and before comparing it to the hash passed into the function.</p>\n<p>Here are some hashed passwords to test the function with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>b305921a3723cd5d70a375cd21a61e60aabb84ec</code> should return \"sammy123\"</li>\n<li><code>c7ab388a5ebefbf4d550652f1eb4d833e5316e3e</code> should return \"abacab\"</li>\n<li><code>5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8</code> should return \"password\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some hashed passwords to test the function with when <code>use_salts</code> is set to <code>True</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>53d8b3dc9d39f0184144674e310185e41a87ffd5</code> should return \"superman\"</li>\n<li><code>da5a4e8cf89539e66097acd2f8af128acae2f8ae</code> should return \"q1w2e3r4t5\"</li>\n<li><code>ea3f62d498e3b98557f9f9cd0d905028b3b019e1</code> should return \"bubbles1\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>hashlib</code> library has been imported for you. You should consider using it in your code. <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Learn more about \"hashlib\" here</a>.</p>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>Write your code in <code>password_cracker.py</code>. For development, you can use <code>main.py</code> to test your code.</p>\n<h2>Testing</h2>\n<p>The unit tests for this project are in <code>test_module.py</code>. We imported the tests from <code>test_module.py</code> to <code>main.py</code> for your convenience.</p>\n<h2>Submitting</h2>\n<p>Copy your project's URL and submit it to freeCodeCamp.</p>\n</section>",
