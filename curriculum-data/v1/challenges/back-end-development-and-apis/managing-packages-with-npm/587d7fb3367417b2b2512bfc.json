However, that’s not the only use case for the description, it’s a great way to summarize what a project does. It’s just as important in any Node.js project to help other developers, future maintainers or even your future self understand the project quickly.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what you plan for your project, a description is definitely recommended. Here's an example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"description\": \"A project that does something awesome\",\n</code></pre>\n</section>",
