  "description": "<section id=\"description\">\n<p>Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clone <a href=\"https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">this GitHub repo</a> and complete these challenges locally.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">our Gitpod starter project</a> to complete these challenges.</li>\n<li>Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <code>package.json</code> file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. There are only two required fields; <code>name</code> and <code>version</code>, but it’s good practice to provide additional information.</p>\n<p>You can create the <code>package.json</code> file from the terminal using the <code>npm init</code> command. This will run a guided setup. Using <code>npm init</code> with the <code>-y</code> flag will generate the file without having it ask any questions, <code>npm init -y</code>.</p>\n<p>If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the <code>package.json</code> file on the top level of the tree. This is the file that you will be improving in the next couple of challenges.</p>\n<p>One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the <code>author</code> field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details. An object is recommended for bigger projects, but a simple string like the following example will do for this project.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-json\">\"author\": \"Jane Doe\",\n</code></pre>\n</section>",
  "instructions": "<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Add your name as the <code>author</code> of the project in the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember that you’re writing JSON, so all field names must use double-quotes (\") and be separated with a comma (,).</p>\n<p>If you are using Gitpod, make sure the app is running and the preview window is open. Copy the preview window's URL and paste it into the Solution Link input below.</p>\n</section>",
