Use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.</p>\n<p>The first two cells of this notebook import libraries and the data.</p>\n<p>Make sure to convert categorical data to numbers. Use 80% of the data as the <code>train_dataset</code> and 20% of the data as the <code>test_dataset</code>.</p>\n<p><code>pop</code> off the \"expenses\" column from these datasets to create new datasets called <code>train_labels</code> and <code>test_labels</code>. Use these labels when training your model.</p>\n<p>Create a model and train it with the <code>train_dataset</code>. Run the final cell in this notebook to check your model. The final cell will use the unseen <code>test_dataset</code> to check how well the model generalizes.</p>\n<p>To pass the challenge, <code>model.evaluate</code> must return a Mean Absolute Error of under 3500. This means it predicts health care costs correctly within $3500.</p>\n<p>The final cell will also predict expenses using the <code>test_dataset</code> and graph the results.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":10,"helpCategory":"Python","superBlock":"machine-learning-with-python","block":"machine-learning-with-python-projects","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"machine-learning-with-python-projects","slug":"/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator","tests":[{"text":"<p>It should pass all Python tests.</p>","testString":""}]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/machine-learning-with-python/#machine-learning-with-python-projects","dashedName":"linear-regression-health-costs-calculator","certification":"machine-learning-with-python","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"machine-learning-with-python","block":"machine-learning-with-python-projects","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"machine-learning-with-python-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier","prevChallengePath":"/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/book-recommendation-engine-using-knn","id":"5e46f8edac417301a38fb930"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":10,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/linear-regression-health-costs-calculator"}},
