This means it occurs at least once, and may be repeated.</p>\n<p>You can use the <code>+</code> character to check if that is the case. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively. That is, the character has to repeat one after the other.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>/a+/g</code> would find one match in <code>abc</code> and return <code>[\"a\"]</code>. Because of the <code>+</code>, it would also find a single match in <code>aabc</code> and return <code>[\"aa\"]</code>.</p>\n<p>If it were instead checking the string <code>abab</code>, it would find two matches and return <code>[\"a\", \"a\"]</code> because the <code>a</code> characters are not in a row - there is a <code>b</code> between them. Finally, since there is no <code>a</code> in the string <code>bcd</code>, it wouldn't find a match.</p>\n</section>","id":"587d7db6367417b2b2512b99","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>You want to find matches when the letter <code>s</code> occurs one or more times in <code>Mississippi</code>.
