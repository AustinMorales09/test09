This object has several methods, and you will learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is <code>app.listen(port)</code>. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background so we added this method in the <code>server.js</code> file for you.</p>\n<p>Letâ€™s serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure: <code>app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)</code>. METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. Handlers take the form <code>function(req, res) {...}</code>, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">function(req, res) {\n  res.send('Response String');\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>will serve the string 'Response String'.</p>\n</section>","instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Use the <code>app.get()</code> method to serve the string \"Hello Express\" to GET requests matching the <code>/</code> (root) path. Be sure that your code works by looking at the logs, then see the results in the preview if you are using Gitpod.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> All the code for these lessons should be added in between the few lines of code we have started you off with.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":2,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"back-end-development-and-apis","block":"basic-node-and-express","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"basic-node-and-express","slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/start-a-working-express-server","tests":[{"text":"<p>Your app should serve the string 'Hello Express'</p>","testString":"(getUserInput) =>\n  $.get(getUserInput('url')).then(\n    (data) => {\n      assert.equal(\n        data,\n        'Hello Express',\n        'Your app does not serve the text \"Hello Express\"'\n      );\n    },\n    (xhr) => {\n      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);\n    }\n  );"}]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#basic-node-and-express","dashedName":"start-a-working-express-server","certification":"back-end-development-and-apis","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"back-end-development-and-apis","block":"basic-node-and-express","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"basic-node-and-express","nextChallengePath":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/serve-an-html-file","prevChallengePath":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/meet-the-node-console","id":"587d7fb0367417b2b2512bee"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":2,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/basic-node-and-express/start-a-working-express-server"}},
