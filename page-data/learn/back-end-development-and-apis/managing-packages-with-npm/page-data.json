This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the <code>package.json</code> file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.</p>\n<p>npm saves packages in a folder named <code>node_modules</code>. These packages can be installed in two ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>globally in a root <code>node_modules</code> folder, accessible by all projects.</li>\n<li>locally within a project's own <code>node_modules</code> folder, accessible only to that project.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.</p>\n<p>Working on these challenges involves writing code on Replit in our starter project.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start by importing the project on Replit.</li>\n<li>Next, you will see a <code>.replit</code> window.</li>\n<li>Select <code>Use run command</code> and click the <code>Done</code> button.</li>\n<li>Complete each challenge and copy the public Replit URL (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optionally, you may write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.</p>\n<p>Start this project by cloning <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-npm/'>this repository</a> on GitHub!</p>"},"allChallengeNode":{"edges":[{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/how-to-use-package-json-the-core-of-any-node-js-project-or-npm-package"},"title":"How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-description-to-your-package-json"},"title":"Add a Description to Your package.json"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/add-keywords-to-your-package-json"},"title":"Add Keywords to Your package.json"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-license-to-your-package-json"},"title":"Add a License to Your package.json"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/add-a-version-to-your-package-json"},"title":"Add a Version to Your package.json"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/expand-your-project-with-external-packages-from-npm"},"title":"Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/manage-npm-dependencies-by-understanding-semantic-versioning"},"title":"Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/use-the-tilde-character-to-always-use-the-latest-patch-version-of-a-dependency"},"title":"Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/use-the-caret-character-to-use-the-latest-minor-version-of-a-dependency"},"title":"Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/remove-a-package-from-your-dependencies"},"title":"Remove a Package from Your Dependencies"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"block":"managing-packages-with-npm","slug":"/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/"}},
