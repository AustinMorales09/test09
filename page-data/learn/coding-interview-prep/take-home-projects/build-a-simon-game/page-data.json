Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I am presented with a random series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.</p>\n<p><strong>Hint:</strong> Here are mp3s you can use for each button: <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound1.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound2.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound3.mp3</code>, <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound4.mp3</code>.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":3,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"take-home-projects","slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-simon-game","tests":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects","dashedName":"build-a-simon-game","certification":"coding-interview-prep","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"take-home-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-freecodecamp-forum-homepage","prevChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game","id":"bd7158d8c442eddfaeb5bd1c"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":3,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-simon-game"}},
