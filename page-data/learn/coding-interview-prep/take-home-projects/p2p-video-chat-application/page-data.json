Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Upon arriving, the browser will prompt me to access my camera and microphone.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> After I give it permission, I am prompted to type in a room name.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Once I type in the room name, a room will be created if no room of that name existed before.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> A friend of mine can subsequently go to the same website, type in the same room I entered, and join the same room, then enter into a video chat with me.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If I type in a room name, and there are already two people in that room, I get a notification that the room is full.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Anyone can create or join any room. And there can be any number of rooms, but all of them must have unique names.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can choose to not permit the site to access my microphone and webcam. If I choose not to do this, or if some other driver problem occurs, I see an error message saying these are required.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> When I choose to cancel the room name input step, or if I type in no name, or just spaces, it should again ask me again to type in a valid room name.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> If one of the two people in the room get disconnected, they can reconnect to the same room and continue chatting.</p>\n<p>Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":4,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"take-home-projects","slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/p2p-video-chat-application","tests":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects","dashedName":"p2p-video-chat-application","certification":"coding-interview-prep","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"take-home-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-national-contiguity-with-a-force-directed-graph","prevChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game","id":"bd7150d8c442eddfafb5bd1c"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":3,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/p2p-video-chat-application"}},
