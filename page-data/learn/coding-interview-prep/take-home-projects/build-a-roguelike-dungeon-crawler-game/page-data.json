Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can move throughout a map, discovering items.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> When I find and beat the boss, I win.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":3,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"take-home-projects","slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game","tests":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects","dashedName":"build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game","certification":"coding-interview-prep","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"take-home-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/p2p-video-chat-application","prevChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-the-game-of-life","id":"bd7153d8c242eddfaeb5bd13"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":3,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-roguelike-dungeon-crawler-game"}},
