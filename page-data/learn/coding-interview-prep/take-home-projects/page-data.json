One of the solutions is giving the applicant a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job.</p>\n<p>The interview after the project submission could be a discussion about the applicant’s design decisions, scalability, and what the applicant might have done differently. This approach is more effective when the applicant doesn’t have a lot of publicly available past projects.</p>\n<p>In this section you get the chance to work on many Take Home Projects like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show Local Weather using Weather API and Geolocation</li>\n<li>Build a Wikipedia Viewer using Wikipedia's API</li>\n<li>Build a Pinterest Clone using Masonry.js library\nand many more!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By the end of this section, you will have plenty of Take Home Projects under your belt. This will boost your confidence and prepare you for Take Home Project Interviews.
