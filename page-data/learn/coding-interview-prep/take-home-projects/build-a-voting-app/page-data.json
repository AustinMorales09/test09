Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.</p>\n<p>Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can keep my polls and come back later to access them.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can share my polls with my friends.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can see the aggregate results of my polls.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, you can create a poll with any number of possible items.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see and vote on everyone's polls.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, you can see the results of polls in chart form.
