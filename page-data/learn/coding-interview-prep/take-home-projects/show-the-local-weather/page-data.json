Figure it out for yourself.</p>\n<p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see the weather in my current location.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.</p>\n<p><strong>User Story:</strong> I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (<code>https://</code>) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API <a href=\"https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to <a href=\"https://codepen.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">CodePen.io</a> via <code>https://</code>.</p>\n<p>When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the \"I've completed this challenge\" button.</p>\n<p>You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href=\"https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":3,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"take-home-projects","slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather","tests":[]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/#take-home-projects","dashedName":"show-the-local-weather","certification":"coding-interview-prep","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"take-home-projects","isFirstStep":true,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"take-home-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/build-a-wikipedia-viewer","prevChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/depth-first-search","id":"bd7158d8c442eddfaeb5bd10"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":3,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather"}},
