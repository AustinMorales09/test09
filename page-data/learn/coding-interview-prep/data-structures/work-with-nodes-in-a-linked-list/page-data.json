You have your hands on the next person in the line, and the person behind you has their hands on you. You can see the person straight ahead of you, but they are blocking the view of the other people ahead in line. A node is just like a person in a conga line: they know who they are and they can only see the next person in line, but they are not aware of the other people ahead or behind them.</p>\n</section>","id":"587d8251367417b2b2512c61","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>In our code editor, we've created two nodes, <code>Kitten</code> and <code>Puppy</code>, and we've manually connected the <code>Kitten</code> node to the <code>Puppy</code> node.</p>\n<p>Create a <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> node and manually add them to the line.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301721,"fields":{"blockName":"data-structures","slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/work-with-nodes-in-a-linked-list","tests":[{"text":"<p>Your <code>Puppy</code> node should have a reference to a <code>Cat</code> node.</p>","testString":"assert(Puppy.next.element === 'Cat');"},{"text":"<p>Your <code>Cat</code> node should have a reference to a <code>Dog</code> node.</p>","testString":"assert(Cat.next.element === 'Dog');"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"var Node = function(element) {\n  this.element = element;\n  this.next = null;\n};\nvar Kitten = new Node('Kitten');\nvar Puppy = new Node('Puppy');\n\nKitten.next = Puppy;\n// Only change code below this line","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/#data-structures","dashedName":"work-with-nodes-in-a-linked-list","certification":"coding-interview-prep","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"coding-interview-prep","block":"data-structures","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"data-structures","nextChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-linked-list-class","prevChallengePath":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/create-a-hash-table","id":"587d8251367417b2b2512c61"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"function dfs(graph, root) {\n    var stack = [];\n    var tempV;\n    var visited = [];\n    var tempVNeighbors = [];\n    stack.push(root);\n    while (stack.length > 0) {\n        tempV = stack.pop();\n        if (visited.indexOf(tempV) == -1) {\n            visited.push(tempV);\n            tempVNeighbors = graph[tempV];\n            for (var i = 0; i < tempVNeighbors.length; i++) {\n                if (tempVNeighbors[i] == 1) {\n                    stack.push(i);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return visited;\n}","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/coding-interview-prep/data-structures/work-with-nodes-in-a-linked-list"}},
