You will see how you can factor an equation and solve for a certain variable in Python. By the end of this unit, you will be able to solve and graph the system with one block of code.</p>"},"allChallengeNode":{"edges":[{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-how-to-solve-systems-of-equations/solving-systems"},"title":"Solving Systems"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-how-to-solve-systems-of-equations/solving-systems-of-equations-extra"},"title":"Solving Systems of Equations: Extra"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"block":"learn-how-to-solve-systems-of-equations","slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-how-to-solve-systems-of-equations/"}},
