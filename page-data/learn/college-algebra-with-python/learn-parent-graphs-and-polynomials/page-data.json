Polynomials are mathematical expressions with \"multiple things\" - the more complicated equations that are built with basic patterns. You will see what these graphs look like, how to modify them, and how to do this all with Python code.</p>"},"allChallengeNode":{"edges":[{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-parent-graphs-and-polynomials/parent-graphs"},"title":"Parent Graphs"}}},{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-parent-graphs-and-polynomials/parent-graphs-and-polynomials-extra"},"title":"Parent Graphs and Polynomials: Extra"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"block":"learn-parent-graphs-and-polynomials","slug":"/learn/college-algebra-with-python/learn-parent-graphs-and-polynomials/"}},
