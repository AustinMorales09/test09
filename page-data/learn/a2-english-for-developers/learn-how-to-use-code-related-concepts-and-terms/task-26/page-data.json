They typically invert the subject and the verb, like in <code>Are you sure?</code> This form is commonly used in everyday conversations, especially when quick and clear answers are needed.</p>\n<p>Indirect questions or statements, on the other hand, are more polite and less direct. They do not invert the subject and the verb and often begin with phrases like <code>I was wondering</code> or <code>Could you tell me</code>. For example, instead of asking <code>Where do you live?</code> you might say, <code>Could you tell me where you live?</code> This makes the question sound less abrupt and more polite, which is particularly useful in formal settings or when you're speaking with someone you don't know well.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p>Direct question: <code>What time is it?</code> (inversion of verb <code>is</code> and subject <code>it</code>)</p>\n<p>Indirect statement: <code>Please tell me what time it is.</code> (no inversion)</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms/task-26","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>I see many functions in our code, but I'm not sure _ each of _ _.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"what","feedback":"<p>This <code>wh-</code> word is used to ask for specific information about the function or role of the items being discussed.</p>"},{"answer":"these","feedback":"<p>This pronoun refers to a specific group of items previously mentioned, in this case, the functions in the code.</p>"},{"answer":"does","feedback":"<p>This verb is used to inquire about the action or role of each individual item.</p>"}]},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"company2-roof.png","characters":[{"character":"Tom","position":{"x":50,"y":15,"z":1.2},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"5.2-2.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":9.74,"finishTimestamp":13.52},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":4.78,"dialogue":{"text":"I see many functions in our code, but I'm not sure what each of these does.","align":"center"}},{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":0,"startTime":5.28,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null}]},"translationPending":false,"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms","dashedName":"task-26","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms/task-27","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms/task-25","id":"66330444cf1ea28af44e980d"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":19,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-code-related-concepts-and-terms/task-26"}},
