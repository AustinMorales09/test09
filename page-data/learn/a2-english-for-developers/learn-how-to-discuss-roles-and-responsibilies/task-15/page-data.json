For example, <code>The test was quite difficult.</code> This means the test was very difficult, but not to the extreme.</p>\n<p><code>Serious</code> means showing deep thought, not joking, or focusing intensely on something important. For example, <code>He is serious about learning English.</code> This shows he is very focused and committed to learning English, not doing it just for fun.</p>\n<p><code>Organized</code> means arranged or planned well, making sure everything is where it should be or done at the right time.
