It indicates that something happens first. For example, <code>I eat breakfast before I go to work</code> means that eating breakfast happens earlier in time than going to work.</p>\n<p><code>After</code> is used to describe something that happens later than another event or time. It indicates the sequence of events where something happens following something else. For example, <code>I go home after work</code> means that going home happens later in time than finishing work.</p>\n<p><code>Around</code> is used with time expressions indicates a time close to but not exactly at that point. It suggests flexibility within a short time frame. For example, <code>We'll meet around noon</code> can mean any time close to 12:00 PM, like 11:45 AM or 12:15 PM. It's commonly used to give a general idea of timing without being too specific.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks/task-38","blockName":"learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>When does Anna say the lunch break is?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p><code>Before noon.</code></p>","feedback":"<p>Noon is in the middle of the day, not in the morning.</p>"},{"answer":"<p><code> After noon.</code></p>","feedback":"<p>Noon indicates midday, not a time in the afternoon.</p>"},{"answer":"<p><code>Just before work ends.</code></p>","feedback":"<p>Noon is mentioned as lunchtime, not as the end of the workday.</p>"},{"answer":"<p><code>Around noon.</code></p>","feedback":null}],"solution":4},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"interview-room3.png","characters":[{"character":"Anna","position":{"x":50,"y":15,"z":1.2},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"2.1-2.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":32.36,"finishTimestamp":35.02},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Anna","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Anna","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":3.66,"dialogue":{"text":"You have a one-hour lunch break around noon every day.","align":"center"}},{"background":null,"character":"Anna","position":null,"opacity":0,"startTime":4.16,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null}]},"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks","dashedName":"task-38","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks/task-39","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks/task-37","id":"657e2c85b80142efb0dcb6fa"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":22,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-talk-about-a-typical-workday-and-tasks/task-38"}},
