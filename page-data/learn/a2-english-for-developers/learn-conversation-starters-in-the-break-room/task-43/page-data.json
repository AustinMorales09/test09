Using <code>they</code> in this way ensures that you don't make assumptions about people. Example:</p>\n<p>Imagine there is a new team member joining your programming project, but you haven’t met them yet. Instead of assuming their gender, you can ask your supervisor, <code>What are they like?</code></p>\n<p>This question helps you find out about the new member's personality, such as being organized, creative, or detail-oriented.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> The question <code>What are they like?</code> can also refer to multiple people or a group. For example, if you're asking about a new team or a group of people you will be working with, you can use this question to learn about the group's personality or dynamic.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room/task-43","blockName":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>Choose the correct question for asking about a person's personality and character traits in a gender-neutral way.</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p><code>What do they like?</code></p>","feedback":"<p><code>What do they like?</code> is used to inquire about someone's preferences or interests.</p>"},{"answer":"<p><code>What is they like?</code></p>","feedback":"<p><code>What is they like?</code> is not grammatically correct in English.</p>"},{"answer":"<p><code>What are they like?</code></p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p><code>What do they looks like?</code></p>","feedback":"<p><code>What do they looks like?</code> is incorrect; it mixes up the structure for asking about personality with the structure for asking about physical appearance and also uses a plural verb <code>looks</code> with a singular pronoun <code>they.</code></p>"}],"solution":3},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","dashedName":"task-43","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room/task-44","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room/task-42","id":"657cb68bf15f349a744b5fba"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":22,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room/task-43"}},
