The time of the action is before now but not specified, and the person using it is usually more interested in the result than in the action itself. For example:</p>\n<p><code>I played this game yesterday.</code>  - This is in the simple past tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at a specific time in the past, which is yesterday.</p>\n<p><code>I have played this game before.</code> - This is in the present perfect tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.</p>\n<p><code>Iâ€™ve played this game before.</code> - This sentence is also in the present perfect tense, using the contraction <code>I've</code> for <code>I have</code>. Like the previous example, it states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room/task-14","blockName":"learn-conversation-starters-in-the-break-room","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>What is Tom's response to Sarah's question about the games?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>He hasn't played the games before.</p>","feedback":"<p>Tom confirms he has experience with the games, not that he hasn't played them.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>He doesn't like the games.</p>","feedback":"<p>Tom doesn't express disliking the games but confirms he's played them.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>He has played the games before.</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>He doesn't know the games.</p>","feedback":"<p>Tom's response indicates familiarity with the games, not lack of knowledge.</p>"}],"solution":3},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"company1-reception.png","characters":[{"character":"Sarah","position":{"x":50,"y":0,"z":1.4},"opacity":0},{"character":"Tom","position":{"x":50,"y":15,"z":1.2},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"1.3-1.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":23.55,"finishTimestamp":30},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Sarah","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Sarah","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":4.73,"dialogue":{"text":"'Monopoly' and 'Ticket to Ride' are popular choices.
