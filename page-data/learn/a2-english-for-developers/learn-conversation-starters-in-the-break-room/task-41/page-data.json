Use <code>does</code> with singular pronouns <code>(he, she)</code> when referring to one person and <code>do</code> with <code>they</code> when referring to someone whose gender might not be known or if referring to people in a non-binary or plural sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember that questions about a person's appearance can be sensitive. Some people may not feel comfortable discussing physical traits, and it's important to respect their feelings.
