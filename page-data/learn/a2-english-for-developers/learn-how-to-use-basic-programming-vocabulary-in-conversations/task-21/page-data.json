This information can be numbers, text, or other types of data. You can change what's in the box, which is why it's called a <code>variable</code> â€“ because it can vary. For example, in <code>x = 5</code>, <code>x</code> temporarily holds the value 5.</p>\n<p>A <code>data type</code> is a classification that specifies the type of data that a <code>variable</code> can hold. Common <code>data types</code> include integers (whole numbers), floats (numbers with a decimal), strings (text), and booleans (true or false). For example, if <code>age = 21</code>, the <code>data type</code> is an integer.</p>\n<p>A <code>conditional statement</code> is a command that tells the computer to do something only if a specific condition is true. It's like making a decision in real life based on a certain situation. Common <code>conditional statements</code> are <code>if-else</code> statements. For example, <code>if (temperature > 20) {console.log(\"It's warm outside!\");}</code> is a <code>conditional statement</code> that executes <code>{console.log(\"It's warm outside!\")</code> if the temperature is above 20 degrees.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-21","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>I've learned about _, _ _, and even _ _ in _ languages.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"variables","feedback":"<p>It refers to names in code storing values that can change during program execution.</p>"},{"answer":"data","feedback":"<p>It refers to the information or values that are used and processed by a computer program.</p>"},{"answer":"types","feedback":"<p>They are the various categories or kinds of data that a programming language can recognize and handle.</p>"},{"answer":"conditional","feedback":"<p>This adjective describes a type of programming statement that depends on a specific condition being met.</p>"},{"answer":"statements","feedback":"<p>They are the individual commands or lines of code that a computer program executes.</p>"},{"answer":"many","feedback":"<p>This word is used to indicate a large number of something, usually with countable nouns.</p>"}]},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"company2-breakroom.png","characters":[{"character":"Sophie","position":{"x":50,"y":0,"z":1.4},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"5.1-1.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":15.04,"finishTimestamp":19.92},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Sophie","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Sophie","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":5.88,"dialogue":{"text":"I've learned about variables, data types, and even conditional statements in many languages.","align":"center"}},{"background":null,"character":"Sophie","position":null,"opacity":0,"startTime":6.38,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null}]},"translationPending":false,"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","dashedName":"task-21","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-22","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-20","id":"662a35f7eaaa932ab0973d0c"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":19,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-21"}},
