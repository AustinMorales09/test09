They can be one, two, three, or more. You can use numbers, and quantifiers such as <code>many</code>, <code>a few</code> or <code>several</code> to describe countable nouns. For example, apple: you can have <code>one apple</code>, <code>two apples</code> or <code>many apples</code>.</p>\n<p>Uncountable nouns are things you cannot count one by one. They usually do not change to show more than one. You don't use numbers directly, instead, use quantifiers like <code>much</code>, <code>a little</code>, <code>some</code> to describe uncountable nouns.
