In many programming languages, including Python, the <code>assignment operator</code> is represented by the <code>=</code> symbol. It tells the computer to store the value on the right side of the <code>=</code> into the variable named on the left side. For example, <code>number = 10</code> assigns the value <code>10</code> to the variable <code>number</code>.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-28","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>In Python, you declare variables by using the variable name and the _ _.
