This class defines the structure of objects, including their attributes and methods. For instance, a <code>Car</code> class might include attributes like <code>color</code> and <code>model</code>, and methods like <code>drive()</code> and <code>brake()</code>.</p>\n<p>The term <code>oriented</code> in this context means aligned or directed towards a particular purpose or principle.</p>\n<p>For example, freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum is described as <code>project-oriented</code> because it is structured around completing projects, which means the teaching method is focused on practical application rather than just theoretical knowledge.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-58","blockName":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>What is <code>object-oriented programming</code> in the context of programming?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>A programming paradigm based on objects</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>An internet technology</p>","feedback":"<p><code>Object-oriented programming</code> is a concept in programming, not specifically an internet technology.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>A type of computer hardware</p>","feedback":"<p><code>OOP</code> is a programming paradigm, not a physical hardware device.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>A software application</p>","feedback":"<p>While <code>OOP</code> can be used in software applications, it is itself a programming concept, not an application.</p>"}],"solution":1},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","dashedName":"task-58","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-59","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/dialogue-3-talking-about-oop","id":"662f113e19790531297cec7b"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":19,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-58"}},
