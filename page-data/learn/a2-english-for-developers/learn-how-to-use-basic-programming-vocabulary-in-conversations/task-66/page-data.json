It acts like a blueprint for creating objects. A <code>class</code> defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (<code>methods</code>) that the objects created from the <code>class</code> can have.</p>\n<p>For example, a <code>Person</code> class might have properties like <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>, and behaviors like <code>talk()</code> and <code>walk()</code>.</p>\n<p>A <code>method</code> is a function that is associated with an object. <code>Methods</code> define the behaviors or actions that an object created from a <code>class</code> can perform. They are like instructions that tell the object what to do.</p>\n<p>For instance, in a <code>Calculator class</code>, a <code>method</code> might be <code>add(number1, number2)</code>, which adds two numbers together.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-66","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>I understand that _ are _ and _, but _ _ used them in my code.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"there","feedback":"<p>This word is used here to introduce the existence or presence of something.</p>"},{"answer":"classes","feedback":"<p>They are blueprints in object-oriented programming from which objects are created.</p>"},{"answer":"methods","feedback":"<p>They are functions associated with a <code>class</code> that define actions the objects of the <code>class</code> can perform.</p>"},{"answer":"I've","feedback":"<p>This is a contraction for <code>I have</code>, used here to describe personal experience with the subject.</p>"},{"answer":"never","feedback":"<p>It is used to indicate that something has not happened at any time in the past.</p>"}]},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"company2-breakroom.png","characters":[{"character":"Tom","position":{"x":50,"y":15,"z":1.2},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"5.1-3.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":12.8,"finishTimestamp":17.12},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":5.32,"dialogue":{"text":"I understand that there are classes and methods, but I've never used them in my code.","align":"center"}},{"background":null,"character":"Tom","position":null,"opacity":0,"startTime":5.82,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null}]},"translationPending":false,"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","dashedName":"task-66","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-67","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-65","id":"662f2e4b96f60636d44eb7db"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":19,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-use-basic-programming-vocabulary-in-conversations/task-66"}},
