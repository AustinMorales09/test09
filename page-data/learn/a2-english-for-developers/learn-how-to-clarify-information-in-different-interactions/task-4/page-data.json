Common colors are <code>black</code>, <code>brown</code>, <code>blonde</code>, <code>red</code>, and <code>gray</code>.</p>\n<p>Type: This describes how the hair looks and feels. Types of hair include <code>straight</code> (no curves), <code>wavy</code> (somewhat growing in curves), and <code>curly</code> (spiralling down).</p>\n<p>Length: This tells us how long the hair is. Hair can be <code>short</code> (above the ears), <code>medium</code> (around the shoulders), or <code>long</code> (past the shoulders).</p>\n<p>In English, however, the sequence of adjectives is important. You'll frequently describe a person's hair by first informing how long it is, then informing its type, and finally the color. For example, you might say someone has <code>short, curly, blonde hair</code>.</p>\n<p>Now fill in the blanks with Tom's description of Lisa's hair.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-4","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>She's a colleague with _ _ _ hair and bright brown eyes.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"long","feedback":"<p>First, the size.
