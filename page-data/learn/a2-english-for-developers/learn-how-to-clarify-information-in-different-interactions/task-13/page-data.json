If you say <code>I work as a developer</code> (<code>Simple Present</code>), you want to inform the other person that this is your occupation. If you say <code>I am working on a project</code> (<code>Present Continuous</code>), you are informing the person what your current task or activity is.</p>\n<p>In a question, you make this distinction by asking <code>What do you do?</code> (<code>Simple Present</code>, used to ask about a person's career or occupation) or <code>What are you doing?</code> (<code>Present Continuous</code>, used to ask about the other person's current activity). When referring to another person, use <code>What does he/she do?</code> or <code>What do they do?</code> (more general and avoids determining a gender to the other person) to know about another person's job and <code>What is he/she doing?</code> or <code>What are they doing?</code> to know about another person's activity at the moment.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-13","blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>Based on the explanation, what does Alice want to know about Lisa?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>She wants to know if Lisa is married</p>","feedback":"<p>Lisa's marital status has nothing to do with Alice's question.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>She wants to know what Alice is doing at the moment.</p>","feedback":"<p>If that was the case, she would use <code>What is he/she doing?</code> or <code>What are they doing?</code> instead.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>She wants to know if Lisa is part of the team</p>","feedback":"<p>Even though the team is mentioned, that's not what Alice is asking about.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>She wants to know Lisa's role in the team, what her job is</p>","feedback":null}],"solution":4},"scene":{"setup":{"background":"company2-center.png","characters":[{"character":"Alice","position":{"x":50,"y":0,"z":1.4},"opacity":0}],"audio":{"filename":"4.3-1.mp3","startTime":1,"startTimestamp":15.08,"finishTimestamp":17.48},"alwaysShowDialogue":null},"commands":[{"background":null,"character":"Alice","position":null,"opacity":1,"startTime":0,"finishTime":null,"dialogue":null},{"background":null,"character":"Alice","position":null,"opacity":null,"startTime":1,"finishTime":3.4,"dialogue":{"text":"Oh, I think I saw her.
