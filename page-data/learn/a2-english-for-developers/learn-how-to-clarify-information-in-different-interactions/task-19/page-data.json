For instance, if someone asks you <code>Do you study English?</code>, you could answer <code>Yes, I study English</code> or <code>No, I don't study English</code>. This, however, is not necessary. Since you have <code>do</code> in the question, you could simply answer by saying <code>Yes, I do.</code> or <code>No, I don't.</code></p>\n<p>Practice this by listening to the dialogues and filling the blanks.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-19","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>Delivery Man: Hi there.
