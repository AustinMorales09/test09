For example, you can say <code>I wanted to be sure I locked the door, so I double checked it</code>. It means you are being careful to avoid mistakes, so you are checking what you did again.</p>\n<p>A <code>schedule</code> is a plan that shows when things will happen. For example, a <code>school schedule</code> shows what time classes start and end. It helps you know what to do at different times of the day. In a project, you could use it to estimate the days certain parts of the project start and end.</p>\n<p><code>Accurate</code> means something is correct and has no mistakes. For example, if a clock shows the right time, it is <code>accurate</code>. It means the information is true and exact.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-54","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>Really?
