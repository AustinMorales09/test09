Common eye colors are <code>black</code>, <code>brown</code>, <code>blue</code>, and <code>green</code>. Depending on the color if can have a tendency to <code>white</code> or to <code>black</code> (the color itself is stronger or weaker). In this case, you can add the words <code>light</code> (tending to <code>white</code>) and <code>dark</code> (tending to <code>black</code>) before the color to express it. Another characteristic that you normally use to identify another person's eyes is the shape - <code>round</code> when it is more like a circle and <code>narrow</code> when it is more similar to a line. Finally, you can refer to them in terms of their size, <code>large</code> (when they are big) or <code>small</code> (when they are not). Tom also expresses an opinion, saying Lisa's eyes are full of energy and vitality. In this case, you say one's eyes is <code>bright</code>.</p>\n<p>As you do with <code>hair</code>, the adjectives to identify a person's eyes also follow an order in English. First, you express this opinion, then move on to the size, then the shape and finally the color (preceded or not by <code>light</code> or <code>dark</code>).</p>\n<p>Example: <code>Tom has beautiful, small, narrow, light green eyes.</code></p>\n<p>Now listen and fill in the blanks with Tom's description of Lisa's eyes.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-5","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and _ _ eyes.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"bright","feedback":"<p>Tom expresses an opinion first.
