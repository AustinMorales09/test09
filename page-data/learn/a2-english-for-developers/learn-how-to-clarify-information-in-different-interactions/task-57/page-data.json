It is possible, however, to use the same structure to talk about future events that are already part of a schedule. Example: If a doctor says <code>I am seeing a patient at 4.</code>, they mean there is a patient scheduled to see them at that time. The event will happen in the future, but it is possible to use the <code>Present Continuous</code> tense to express it.</p>\n<p>Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-clarify-information-in-different-interactions/task-57","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>Well, the documentation says we_ _ the testing phase next week, but you mentioned it was the following week.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"'re","feedback":"<p>This blank has the contraction of the verb <code>to be</code> that follows <code>we</code>.</p>"},{"answer":"starting","feedback":"<p>A verb similar to <code>begin</code>.
