They ask questions and try to find answers.</p>\n<p><code>Research</code> means trying to find more information about something. You might do research by reading books, looking online, or testing to learn new things. When you talk about <code>scientific research</code>, it normally involves a more formal setting, with regulated conditions.</p>\n<p>The word <code>also</code> can be used in substitution to <code>too</code> and can be added in different places in a sentence. Examples: <code>He can play the guitar, but he plays the piano, too.</code> (<code>too</code> is normally added in the end of the sentence, preceded by a comma). <code>He can play the guitar, but he can also play the piano</code> (you can add <code>also</code> before the verb and in the middle of the sentence).
