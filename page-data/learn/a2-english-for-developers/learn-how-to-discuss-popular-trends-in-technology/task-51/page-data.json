Example: <code>Computers are very useful for calculating things.</code> As you can see, after <code>useful</code>, we have the preposition <code>for</code>, meaning any verb that comes after it has to be in the <code>-ing</code> form (see the example).</p>\n<p><code>Molecules</code> are like tiny building blocks that make up everything. Everything you see and touch is made from molecules. They are groups of two or more atoms together.</p>\n<p><code>Drugs</code> are substances that change how our bodies feel or work. There are two kinds: medicine and illegal drugs. People can take drugs as pills, liquids, or in other ways.</p>\n<p>Fill in the blanks with the correct word from the dialogue.</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology/task-51","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>They're _ for _ things like _ and _.</p>","blanks":[{"answer":"useful","feedback":"<p>Something that can help you perform a task.</p>"},{"answer":"studying","feedback":"<p>The act of spending time learning something.
