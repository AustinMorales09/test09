It indicates a high chance that a particular action will occur in the future. For example, if a certain programming language is easy to use, you might say it is likely to remain popular, meaning it will probably stay popular in the future.</p>\n<p>In English, you can use verbs with the word <code>to</code> before them to talk about different actions. For example, <code>to eat</code>, <code>to run</code>, or <code>to learn</code>. When you talk about something that needs to happen or might happen in the future, you use this structure. For instance, <code>I want to eat</code>, <code>She likes to run</code>, or <code>They need to learn</code>.</p>\n<p>So, <code>to + infinitive</code> is a way you express actions that could or should occur, often indicating plans, desires, or possibilities.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":19,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","fields":{"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology/task-31","blockName":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>What does <code>Python is likely to remain popular</code> mean?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>Python will disappear soon.</p>","feedback":"<p><code>Likely to remain</code> suggests a prediction about the future, not disappearance.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>Python will be popular for a short time.</p>","feedback":"<p><code>Likely to remain</code> implies a lasting popularity, not just a short-lived trend.</p>"},{"answer":"<p>Python is expected to continue being popular.</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>Python will only be used by a few people.</p>","feedback":"<p><code>Likely to remain</code> indicates that Python will continue to be widely used, not limited to a few users.</p>"}],"solution":3},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/#learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","dashedName":"task-31","certification":"a2-english-for-developers","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology","nextChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology/task-32","prevChallengePath":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology/task-30","id":"66192c57ba758e85c4f2d766"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":22,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-popular-trends-in-technology/task-31"}},
