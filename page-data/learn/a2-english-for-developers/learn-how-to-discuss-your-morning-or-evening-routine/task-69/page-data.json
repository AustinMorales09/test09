Here's an example:</p>\n<p><code>I improved by practicing daily</code> (This means I got better at something because I practiced every day. You use the preposition <code>by</code> to show how something is done)</p>\n<p>Adjectives can also change the meaning of the following word by adding details to them. The word <code>light</code> can serve as an adjective to describe something not heavy or not intense. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Light exercises are good for beginners.</code> This means exercises that are not heavy or hard are good for people who are just starting. The word <code>light</code> as an adjective tells you what kind of exercises they are.</p>\n<p>Even words like <code>family</code> and <code>outdoor</code> can be used as adjectives, they describe the noun that follows them. For example:</p>\n<p><code>Family activities bring everyone together.</code> (<code>family</code> describes the type of activities)\n<code>Outdoor sports are enjoyable in good weather.</code> (<code>outdoor</code> describes where the sports happen)</p>\n</section>","instructions":null,"challengeType":22,"helpCategory":"English","superBlock":"a2-english-for-developers","block":"learn-how-to-discuss-your-morning-or-evening-routine","fields":{"blockName":"learn-how-to-discuss-your-morning-or-evening-routine","slug":"/learn/a2-english-for-developers/learn-how-to-discuss-your-morning-or-evening-routine/task-69","tests":[]},"fillInTheBlank":{"sentence":"<p>You can start _ involving your kids in _ activities.
