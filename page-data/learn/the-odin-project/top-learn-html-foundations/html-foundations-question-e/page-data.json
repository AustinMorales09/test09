However, for now it’s only crucial to know about the two elements you have covered here. You will introduce more elements that go into the <code>head</code> throughout the rest of the curriculum.</p>\n<p>Back in <code>index.html</code> file, let’s add a <code>head</code> element with a <code>charset</code> <code>meta</code> element and a <code>title</code> within it.
