Inline styles, which you went over in a previous lesson, have the highest specificity compared to selectors, while each type of selector has its own specificity level that contributes to how specific a declaration is. Other selectors contribute to specificity, but you're focusing only on the ones youâ€™ve gone over so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ID selectors (most specific selector)</li>\n<li>Class selectors</li>\n<li>Type selectors</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Specificity will only be taken into account when an element has multiple, conflicting declarations targeting it, sort of like a tie-breaker. An ID selector will always beat any number of class selectors, a class selector will always beat any number of type selectors, and a type selector will always beat any number of anything less specific than it. When no declaration has a selector with a higher specificity, a larger amount of a single selector will beat a smaller amount of that same selector.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":15,"helpCategory":"Odin","superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-specificity","fields":{"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-specificity/the-cascade-of-css-question-b","blockName":"top-learn-css-specificity","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>Which of the following is the correct order of specificity for CSS selectors, from most specific to least specific?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>Type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>ID selectors, class selectors, type selectors</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>Class selectors, type selectors, ID selectors</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>ID selectors, type selectors, class selectors</p>","feedback":null}],"solution":2},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/the-odin-project/#top-learn-css-specificity","dashedName":"the-cascade-of-css-question-b","certification":"the-odin-project","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-specificity","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"top-learn-css-specificity","nextChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-specificity/the-cascade-of-css-question-c","prevChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-specificity/the-cascade-of-css-question-a","id":"6489c96782cf2e4f86f03ae2"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":15,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-specificity/the-cascade-of-css-question-b"}},
