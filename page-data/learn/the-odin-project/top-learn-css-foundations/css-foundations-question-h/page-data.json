Next, you have the <code>style</code> attribute, with its value within the pair of quotation marks being the declarations.</p>\n<p>If you need to add a unique style for a single element, this method can work just fine. Generally, though, this isn’t exactly a recommended way for adding CSS to HTML for a few reasons:</p>\n<p>It can quickly become pretty messy once you start adding a lot of declarations to a single element, causing your HTML file to become unnecessarily bloated.\nIf you want many elements to have the same style, you would have to copy + paste the same style to each individual element, causing lots of unnecessary repetition and more bloat.\nAny inline CSS will override the other two methods, which can cause unexpected results.
