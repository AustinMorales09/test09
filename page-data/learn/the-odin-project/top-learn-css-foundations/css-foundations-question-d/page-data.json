Let’s say you had the following HTML:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;div class=\"subsection header\">Latest Posts&#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;p class=\"subsection preview\">This is where a preview for a post might go.&#x3C;/p>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You have two elements with the <code>subsection</code> class that have some sort of unique styles, but what if you only want to apply a separate rule to the element that also has <code>header</code> as a second class? Well, you could chain both the <code>class</code> selectors together in your CSS like so:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What <code>.subsection.header</code> does is it selects any element that has both the <code>subsection</code> and <code>header</code> classes. Notice how there isn’t any space between the <code>.subsection</code> and <code>.header</code> <code>class</code> selectors. This syntax basically works for chaining any combination of selectors, except for chaining more than one type selector.</p>\n<p>This can also be used to chain a class and an ID, as shown below:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;div>\n  &#x3C;div class=\"subsection header\">Latest Posts&#x3C;/div>\n  &#x3C;p class=\"subsection\" id=\"preview\">This is where a preview for a post might go.&#x3C;/p>\n&#x3C;/div>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can take the two elements above and combine them with the following:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.subsection.header {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.subsection#preview {\n  color: blue;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like <code>div</code> and <code>p</code> would give us the selector <code>divp</code>, which wouldn’t work since the selector would try to find a literal <code>&#x3C;divp></code> element, which doesn’t exist.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":15,"helpCategory":"Odin","superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-foundations","fields":{"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-d","blockName":"top-learn-css-foundations","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>Given an element that has an <code>id</code> of <code>title</code> and a <code>class</code> of <code>primary</code>, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.title.primary {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<pre><code class=\"language-css\">.title > primary {\n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<pre><code class=\"language-css\">#title.primary { \n  ...\n}\n</code></pre>","feedback":null}],"solution":3},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/the-odin-project/#top-learn-css-foundations","dashedName":"css-foundations-question-d","certification":"the-odin-project","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-foundations","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"top-learn-css-foundations","nextChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-e","prevChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-c","id":"63ee35300d8d4841c3a7091d"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":15,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-d"}},
