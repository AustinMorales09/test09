With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing <code>&#x3C;style></code> tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags of your HTML file. Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the <code>&#x3C;head></code> tags, you no longer need a <code>&#x3C;link></code> element that the external method requires.</p>\n<p>Besides these differences, the syntax is exactly the same as the external method (selector, curly braces, declarations):</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;head>\n  &#x3C;style>\n    div {\n      color: white;\n      background-color: black;\n    }\n\n    p {\n      color: red;\n    }\n  &#x3C;/style>\n&#x3C;/head>\n&#x3C;body>...&#x3C;/body>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website, but it doesnâ€™t keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":15,"helpCategory":"Odin","superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-foundations","fields":{"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-g","blockName":"top-learn-css-foundations","tests":[]},"question":{"text":"<p>Which of the following is a difference between internal and external CSS methods?</p>","answers":[{"answer":"<p>The external method places CSS rules in a separate file, while the internal method places CSS rules within the HTML file itself.</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>The internal method keeps CSS separate from HTML, while the external method embeds CSS directly in HTML.</p>","feedback":null},{"answer":"<p>The internal method uses <code>&#x3C;link></code> element to link CSS to HTML, while the external method embeds CSS directly in HTML.</p>","feedback":null}],"solution":1},"scene":null,"translationPending":false,"assignments":[],"audioPath":null}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/the-odin-project/#top-learn-css-foundations","dashedName":"css-foundations-question-g","certification":"the-odin-project","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"the-odin-project","block":"top-learn-css-foundations","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"top-learn-css-foundations","nextChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-h","prevChallengePath":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-f","id":"63ee35450d8d4841c3a70920"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":15,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/the-odin-project/top-learn-css-foundations/css-foundations-question-g"}},
