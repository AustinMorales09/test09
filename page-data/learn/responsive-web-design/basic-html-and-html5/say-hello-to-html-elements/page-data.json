These will walk you through web development step-by-step.</p>\n<p>First, you'll start by building a simple web page using HTML. You can edit code in your code editor, which is embedded into this web page.</p>\n<p>Do you see the code in your code editor that says <code>&#x3C;h1>Hello&#x3C;/h1></code>? That's an HTML element.</p>\n<p>Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag.</p>\n<p>Opening tags look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;h1>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Closing tags look like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;/h1>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The only difference between opening and closing tags is the forward slash after the opening bracket of a closing tag.</p>\n<p>Each challenge has tests you can run at any time by clicking the \"Run tests\" button. When you pass all tests, you'll be prompted to submit your solution and go to the next coding challenge.</p>\n</section>","id":"bd7123c8c441eddfaeb5bdef","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>To pass the test on this challenge, change your <code>h1</code> element's text to say <code>Hello World</code>.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"challengeType":0,"helpCategory":"HTML-CSS","videoUrl":"https://scrimba.com/p/pVMPUv/cE8Gpt2","superBlock":"responsive-web-design","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":18276,"fields":{"blockName":"basic-html-and-html5","slug":"/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/say-hello-to-html-elements","tests":[{"text":"<p>Your <code>h1</code> element should have the text <code>Hello World</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.isTrue(/hello(\\s)+world/gi.test($('h1').text()));"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"indexhtml","ext":"html","name":"index","contents":"<h1>Hello</h1>","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["index.html"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5","dashedName":"say-hello-to-html-elements","certification":"responsive-web-design","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"responsive-web-design","block":"basic-html-and-html5","isFirstStep":true,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"basic-html-and-html5","nextChallengePath":"/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/headline-with-the-h2-element","prevChallengePath":"/learn/rosetta-code/rosetta-code-challenges/zig-zag-matrix","id":"bd7123c8c441eddfaeb5bdef"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":0,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"index","ext":"html","contents":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n <head>\n  <title>The best page ever</title>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <h1>The best page ever</h1>\n  <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed.
