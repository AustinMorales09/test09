You then need to add the same <code>id</code> attribute to the element you are linking to. An <code>id</code> is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.</p>\n<p>Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-html\">&#x3C;a href=\"#contacts-header\">Contacts&#x3C;/a>\n...\n&#x3C;h2 id=\"contacts-header\">Contacts&#x3C;/h2>\n</code></pre>\n<p>When users click the <code>Contacts</code> link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the <strong>Contacts</strong> heading element.</p>\n</section>","id":"bad88fee1348bd9aedf08816","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Change your external link to an internal link by changing the <code>href</code> attribute to <code>#footer</code> and the text from <code>cat photos</code> to <code>Jump to Bottom</code>.</p>\n<p>Remove the <code>target=\"_blank\"</code> attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.</p>\n<p>Then add an <code>id</code> attribute with a value of <code>footer</code> to the <code>&#x3C;footer></code> element at the bottom of the page.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"challengeType":0,"helpCategory":"HTML-CSS","videoUrl":"https://scrimba.com/p/pVMPUv/cyrDRUL","superBlock":"responsive-web-design","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301098,"fields":{"blockName":"basic-html-and-html5","slug":"/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/link-to-internal-sections-of-a-page-with-anchor-elements","tests":[{"text":"<p>There should be only one anchor tag on your page.</p>","testString":"assert($('a').length == 1);"},{"text":"<p>There should be only one <code>footer</code> tag on your page.</p>","testString":"assert($('footer').length == 1);"},{"text":"<p>The <code>a</code> tag should have an <code>href</code> attribute set to \"#footer\".</p>","testString":"assert($('a').eq(0).attr('href') == '#footer');"},{"text":"<p>The <code>a</code> tag should not have a <code>target</code> attribute.</p>","testString":"assert(\n  typeof $('a').eq(0).attr('target') == typeof undefined ||\n    $('a').eq(0).attr('target') == true\n);"},{"text":"<p>The <code>a</code> text should be \"Jump to Bottom\".</p>","testString":"assert(\n  $('a')\n    .eq(0)\n    .text()\n    .match(/Jump to Bottom/gi)\n);"},{"text":"<p>The <code>footer</code> tag should have an <code>id</code> attribute set to \"footer\".</p>","testString":"assert($('footer').eq(0).attr('id') == 'footer');"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"indexhtml","ext":"html","name":"index","contents":"<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>\n<main>\n\n  <a href=\"https://www.freecatphotoapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">cat photos</a>\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg\" alt=\"A cute orange cat lying on its back.\">\n\n  <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
