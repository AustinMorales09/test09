This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.</p>\n<p>Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.</p>\n<p>Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup</li>\n<li>ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content</li>\n<li>create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.</p>"},"allChallengeNode":{"edges":[{"node":{"challenge":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/add-a-text-alternative-to-images-for-visually-impaired-accessibility"},"title":"Add
