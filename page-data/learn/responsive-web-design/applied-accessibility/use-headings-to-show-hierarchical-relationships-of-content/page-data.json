Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.</p>\n<p><em>Semantic meaning</em> means that the tag you use around content indicates the type of information it contains.</p>\n<p>If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content.</p>\n<p>Headings with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.</p>\n<p>As an example, a page with an <code>h2</code> element followed by several subsections labeled with <code>h4</code> elements would confuse a screen reader user. With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but you can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.</p>\n<p>One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) <code>h1</code> element, which is the main subject of your content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.</p>\n</section>","id":"587d774d367417b2b2512a9e","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Camper Cat wants a page on his site dedicated to becoming a ninja.
