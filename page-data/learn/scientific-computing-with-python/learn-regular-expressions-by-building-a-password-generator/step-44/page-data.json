Raw strings are prefixed with a <code>r</code>. The key distinction from regular strings lies in how they handle the backslash character: in raw strings, backslashes are treated as literal characters rather than escape characters. When writing regular expressions, using raw strings is a good practice, since they can usually contain a lot of <code>\\</code> characters.</p>\n<p>Turn your <code>pattern</code> string into a raw string by prefixing it with a <code>r</code>.</p>\n</section>","id":"6564d97a5ef99783216a6229","hasEditableBoundaries":true,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":20,"helpCategory":"Python","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"scientific-computing-with-python","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":null,"fields":{"blockName":"learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator","slug":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator/step-44","tests":[{"text":"<p>You should modify your <code>pattern</code> variable into <code>r'\\.'</code>.</p>","testString":"({ test: () => assert.match(code, /^pattern\\s*=\\s*r(\"|')\\\\\\.\\1/m) })"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":true,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"mainpy","ext":"py","name":"main","contents":"import re\nimport secrets\nimport string\n\n\ndef generate_password(length, nums, special_chars, uppercase, lowercase):\n    # Define the possible characters for the password\n    letters = string.ascii_letters\n    digits = string.digits\n    symbols = string.punctuation\n\n    # Combine all characters\n    all_characters = letters + digits + symbols\n\n    while True:\n        password = ''\n        # Generate password\n        for _ in range(length):\n            password += secrets.choice(all_characters)\n        \n        constraints = [\n            (nums, '[0-9]'),\n            (lowercase, '[a-z]'),\n            (uppercase, '[A-Z]'),\n            (special_chars, '')\n        ]        \n\n    return password\n    \n# new_password = generate_password(8)\n# print(new_password)\npattern = '\\.'\nquote = 'Not all those who wander are lost.'\nprint(re.findall(pattern, quote))","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[31,35],"history":["main.py"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/#learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator","dashedName":"step-44","certification":"scientific-computing-with-python","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"scientific-computing-with-python","block":"learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator","nextChallengePath":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator/step-45","prevChallengePath":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator/step-43","id":"6564d97a5ef99783216a6229"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":20,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"main","ext":"py","contents":"import re\nimport secrets\nimport string\n\n\ndef generate_password(length=16, nums=1, special_chars=1, uppercase=1, lowercase=1):\n\n    # Define the possible characters for the password\n    letters = string.ascii_letters\n    digits = string.digits\n    symbols = string.punctuation\n\n    # Combine all characters\n    all_characters = letters + digits + symbols\n\n    while True:\n        password = ''\n        # Generate password\n        for _ in range(length):\n            password += secrets.choice(all_characters)\n        \n        constraints = [\n            (nums, r'\\d'),\n            (special_chars, fr'[{symbols}]'),\n            (uppercase, r'[A-Z]'),\n            (lowercase, r'[a-z]')\n        ]\n\n        # Check constraints\n        if all(\n            constraint <= len(re.findall(pattern, password))\n            for constraint, pattern in constraints\n        ):            \n            break\n    \n    return password\n    \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    new_password = generate_password()\n    print('Generated password:', new_password)\n    ","head":"","tail":"","history":["main.py"],"fileKey":"mainpy"}]}},"slug":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-regular-expressions-by-building-a-password-generator/step-44"}},
