You need to populate your first list with numbers representing the various disk sizes.</p>\n<p>Instead of adding the items manually to the first list, generate a sequence of numbers counting down from <code>3</code> to <code>1</code> by using the <code>range()</code> function and assign it to <code>rods['A']</code>. Here, <code>3</code> represents the largest disk at the bottom of the pile and <code>1</code> represents the smallest disk at the top of the pile.</p>\n<p>The syntax is <code>range(x, y, h)</code>, where <code>x</code> is the starting integer (inclusive), <code>y</code> is the last integer (not inclusive), and <code>h</code> is the difference between a number and the next one in the sequence.</p>\n</section>","id":"64dc8ea01436383a88256d7f","hasEditableBoundaries":true,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":20,"helpCategory":"Python","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"scientific-computing-with-python","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":null,"fields":{"blockName":"learn-recursion-by-solving-the-tower-of-hanoi-puzzle","slug":"/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/learn-recursion-by-solving-the-tower-of-hanoi-puzzle/step-3","tests":[{"text":"<p>You should use the <code>range()</code> function to assign a sequence of numbers to <code>rods['A']</code>.
