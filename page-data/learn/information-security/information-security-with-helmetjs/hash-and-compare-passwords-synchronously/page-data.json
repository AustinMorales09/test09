Again, the variables used are already defined in the server so you won't need to adjust them. You may notice even though you are hashing the same password as in the async function, the result in the console is different- this is due to the salt being randomly generated each time as seen by the first 22 characters in the third string of the hash. Now to compare a password input with the new sync hash, you would use the compareSync method:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">var result = bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash);\n</code></pre>\n<p>with the result being a boolean true or false.</p>\n</section>","instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Add the function in and log the result to the console to see it working.</p>\n<p>Submit your page when you think you've got it right.</p>\n</section>","challengeType":2,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","superBlock":"information-security","block":"information-security-with-helmetjs","translationPending":false,"fields":{"blockName":"information-security-with-helmetjs","slug":"/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/hash-and-compare-passwords-synchronously","tests":[{"text":"<p>Sync hash should be generated and correctly compared.</p>","testString":"(getUserInput) =>\n  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/server.js').then(\n    (data) => {\n      assert.match(\n        data,\n        /START_SYNC[^]*hash.*=.*bcrypt.hashSync.*myPlaintextPassword( |),( |)saltRounds[^]*END_SYNC/gi,\n        'You should call bcrypt.hashSync on myPlaintextPassword with saltRounds'\n      );\n      assert.match(\n        data,\n        /START_SYNC[^]*result.*=.*bcrypt.compareSync.*myPlaintextPassword( |),( |)hash[^]*END_SYNC/gi,\n        'You should call bcrypt.compareSync on myPlaintextPassword with the hash generated in the last line'\n      );\n    },\n    (xhr) => {\n      throw new Error(xhr.statusText);\n    }\n  );"}]}}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/information-security/#information-security-with-helmetjs","dashedName":"hash-and-compare-passwords-synchronously","certification":"information-security","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"information-security","block":"information-security-with-helmetjs","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"python-for-penetration-testing","nextChallengePath":"/learn/information-security/python-for-penetration-testing/introduction-and-setup","prevChallengePath":"/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/hash-and-compare-passwords-asynchronously","id":"58a25bcff9fc0f352b528e7e"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":2,"challengeFiles":[]}},"slug":"/learn/information-security/information-security-with-helmetjs/hash-and-compare-passwords-synchronously"}},
