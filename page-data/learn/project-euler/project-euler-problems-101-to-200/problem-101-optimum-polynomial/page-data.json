This is defined by the generating function, $u_n = n^3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, \\ldots$</p>\n<p>Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that \"simple is best\" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.</p>\n<p>We shall define $OP(k, n)$ to be the $n^{th}$ term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that $OP(k, n)$ will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for $n ≤ k$, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be $OP(k, k+1)$; in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).</p>\n<p>As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for $n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u_1$.</p>\n<p>Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:</p>\n<p>$$\\begin{array}{ll}\nOP(1, n) = 1          &#x26; 1, {\\color{red}1}, 1, 1, \\ldots     \\\\\nOP(2, n) = 7n−6       &#x26; 1, 8, {\\color{red}{15}}, \\ldots     \\\\\nOP(3, n) = 6n^2−11n+6 &#x26; 1, 8, 27, {\\color{red}{58}}, \\ldots \\\\\nOP(4, n) = n^3        &#x26; 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, \\ldots\n\\end{array}$$</p>\n<p>Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4. By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in $\\color{red}{red}$ above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74. Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:</p>\n<p>$$u_n = 1 − n + n^2 − n^3 + n^4 − n^5 + n^6 − n^7 + n^8 − n^9 + n^{10}$$</p>\n<p>Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f3d21000cf542c50fee4","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301725,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-101-to-200","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-101-to-200/problem-101-optimum-polynomial","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>optimumPolynomial()</code> should return <code>37076114526</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(optimumPolynomial(), 37076114526);"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function optimumPolynomial() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\noptimumPolynomial();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-101-to-200","dashedName":"problem-101-optimum-polynomial","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-101-to-200","isFirstStep":true,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-101-to-200","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-101-to-200/problem-102-triangle-containment","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-1-to-100/problem-100-arranged-probability","id":"5900f3d21000cf542c50fee4"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-101-to-200/problem-101-optimum-polynomial"}},
