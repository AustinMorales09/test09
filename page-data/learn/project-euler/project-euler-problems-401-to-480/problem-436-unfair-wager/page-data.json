If the second players draws 0.1, 0.27 and 0.91, the second player turn ends since $0.62 + 0.44 + 0.1 + 0.27 + 0.91 > 2$ and $y = 0.91$. Since $y > x$, the second player wins.</p>\n<p>Louise thinks about it for a second, and objects: \"That's not fair\".</p>\n<p>What is the probability that the second player wins?
