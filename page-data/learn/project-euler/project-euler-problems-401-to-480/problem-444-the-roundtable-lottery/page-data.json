Each person starts off with a randomly-assigned, unscratched lottery ticket. Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £$p$, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for each person to maximize his ticket winnings upon leaving the game.</p>\n<p>An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The player can scratch his ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.</li>\n<li>The player can trade his unscratched ticket for a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leave the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches his newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.</p>\n<p>Assume that each player uses the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of his ticket winnings.</p>\n<p>Let $E(p)$ represent the expected number of players left at the table when the game ends in a game consisting of $p$ players (e.g. $E(111) = 5.2912$ when rounded to 5 significant digits).</p>\n<p>Let $S_1(N) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{p = 1}^N E(p)$.</p>\n<p>Let $S_k(N) = \\displaystyle\\sum_{p = 1}^N S_{k - 1}(p)$ for $k > 1$.</p>\n<p>Find $S_{20}({10}^{14})$ and write the answer as a string in scientific notation rounded to 10 significant digits. Use a lowercase <code>e</code> to separate mantissa and exponent. For example, the answer for $S_3(100)$ would be <code>5.983679014e5</code>.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f52a1000cf542c51003b","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":302116,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-444-the-roundtable-lottery","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>roundtableLottery()</code> should return a string.</p>","testString":"assert(typeof roundtableLottery() === 'string');"},{"text":"<p><code>roundtableLottery()</code> should return the string <code>1.200856722e263</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(roundtableLottery(), '1.200856722e263');"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function roundtableLottery() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nroundtableLottery();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-401-to-480","dashedName":"problem-444-the-roundtable-lottery","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-445-retractions-a","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-443-gcd-sequence","id":"5900f52a1000cf542c51003b"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-444-the-roundtable-lottery"}},
