Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Your guess is lower than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of a), or</li>\n<li>\"Your guess is higher than the hidden number\" (and you incur a cost of b), or</li>\n<li>\"Yes, that's it!\" (and the game ends).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given the value of $n$, $a$, and $b$, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost <u>for the worst possible case</u>.</p>\n<p>For example, if $n = 5$, $a = 2$, and $b = 3$, then we may begin by asking \"<strong>2</strong>\" as our first question.</p>\n<p>If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of $b = 3$), then we are sure that \"<strong>1</strong>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of <strong><span style=\"color: blue;\">3</span></strong>).</p>\n<p>If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of $a = 2$), then our next question will be \"<strong>4</strong>\".</p>\n<p>If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of $b = 3$), then we are sure that \"<strong>3</strong>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of $2 + 3 = \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{5}}$).</p>\n<p>If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of $a = 2$), then we are sure that \"<strong>5</strong>\" is the hidden number (for a total cost of $2 + 2 = \\color{blue}{\\mathbf{4}}$).</p>\n<p>Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is <strong><span style=\"color: red\">5</span></strong>. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.</p>\n<p>Let $C(n, a, b)$ be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of $n$, $a$, and $b$.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples:</p>\n<p>$$\\begin{align}\n&#x26; C(5, 2, 3) = 5 \\\\\n&#x26; C(500, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) = 13.220\\,731\\,97\\ldots \\\\\n&#x26; C(20\\,000, 5, 7) = 82 \\\\\n&#x26; C(2\\,000\\,000, √5, √7) = 49.637\\,559\\,55\\ldots \\\\\n\\end{align}$$</p>\n<p>Let $F_k$ be the Fibonacci numbers: $F_k = F_{k - 1} + F_{k - 2}$ with base cases $F_1 = F_2 = 1$.</p>\n<p>Find $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k = 1}^{30} C({10}^{12}, \\sqrt{k}, \\sqrt{F_k})$, and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f5021000cf542c510015","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":302074,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-406-guessing-game","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>guessingGame()</code> should return <code>36813.12757207</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(guessingGame(), 36813.12757207);"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function guessingGame() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nguessingGame();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-401-to-480","dashedName":"problem-406-guessing-game","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-401-to-480","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-407-idempotents","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-405-a-rectangular-tiling","id":"5900f5021000cf542c510015"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-401-to-480/problem-406-guessing-game"}},
