We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition $a ≤ b$.</p>\n<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet. For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"two arrangements of mats in 4x4 room\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/tatami-free-rooms.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red \"<strong><span style=\"color: red;\">X</span></strong>\" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>\n<p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms. Further, we define $T(s)$ as the number of tatami-free rooms of size $s$.</p>\n<p>The smallest tatami-free room has size $s = 70$ and dimensions 7×10. All the other rooms of size $s = 70$ can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14. Hence, $T(70) = 1$.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we can verify that $T(1320) = 5$ because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size $s = 1320$: 20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40. In fact, $s = 1320$ is the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 5$.</p>\n<p>Find the smallest room-size $s$ for which $T(s) = 200$.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f46c1000cf542c50ff7e","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301904,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-201-to-300","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-201-to-300/problem-256-tatami-free-rooms","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>tatamiFreeRooms()</code> should return <code>85765680</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(tatamiFreeRooms(), 85765680);"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function tatamiFreeRooms() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\ntatamiFreeRooms();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-201-to-300","dashedName":"problem-256-tatami-free-rooms","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-201-to-300","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-201-to-300","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-201-to-300/problem-257-angular-bisectors","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-201-to-300/problem-255-rounded-square-roots","id":"5900f46c1000cf542c50ff7e"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-201-to-300/problem-256-tatami-free-rooms"}},
