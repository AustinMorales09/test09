The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.).</p>\n<p>Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the $n^{\\text{th}}$ person is assigned a room: person $n$ gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the floor is empty</li>\n<li>the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person $m$, then $m + n$ is a perfect square</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.</p>\n<p>Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square.</p>\n<p>Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.</p>\n<p>Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.</p>\n<p>Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.</p>\n<p>Define $P(f, r)$ to be $n$ if person $n$ occupies room $r$ in floor $f$, and 0 if no person occupies the room.
