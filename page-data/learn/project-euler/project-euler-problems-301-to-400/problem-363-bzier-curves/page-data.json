(Please note that for all points the value of $t$ is the same.)</p>\n<p>From the construction it is clear that the Bézier curve will be tangent to the segments $P_0P_1$ in $P_0$ and $P_2P_3$ in $P_3$.</p>\n<p>A cubic Bézier curve with $P_0 = (1, 0)$, $P_1 = (1, v)$, $P_2 = (v, 1)$ and $P_3 = (0, 1)$ is used to approximate a quarter circle. The value $v > 0$ is chosen such that the area enclosed by the lines $OP_0$, $OP_3$ and the curve is equal to $\\frac{π}{4}$ (the area of the quarter circle).</p>\n<p>By how many percent does the length of the curve differ from the length of the quarter circle? That is, if $L$ is the length of the curve, calculate $100 × \\displaystyle\\frac{L − \\frac{π}{2}}{\\frac{π}{2}}$. Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f4d91000cf542c50ffeb","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":302024,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-363-bzier-curves","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>bezierCurves()</code> should return <code>0.0000372091</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(bezierCurves(), 0.0000372091);"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function bezierCurves() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nbezierCurves();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-301-to-400","dashedName":"problem-363-bzier-curves","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-364-comfortable-distance","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-362-squarefree-factors","id":"5900f4d91000cf542c50ffeb"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-363-bzier-curves"}},
