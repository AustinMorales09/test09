Its grid spacing is 1.</p>\n<p>When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.</p>\n<p>For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 4, we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 2, 12 × 3 and 6 × 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"sheet with 9 x 4 dimensions cut in three different ways to make rectangles with 18 x 2, 12 x 3 and 6 x 6 dimensions\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/cutting-rectangular-grid-paper.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 8, we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 4 and 12 × 6.</p>\n<p>For a pair $w$ and $h$, let $F(w, h)$ be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions $w$ × $h$. For example, $F(2, 1) = 0$, $F(2, 2) = 1$, $F(9, 4) = 3$ and $F(9, 8) = 2$. Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in $F(w, h)$. Note also that rectangles with dimensions $w$ × $h$ and dimensions $h$ × $w$ are not considered distinct.</p>\n<p>For an integer $N$, let $G(N)$ be the sum of $F(w, h)$ for all pairs $w$ and $h$ which satisfy $0 &#x3C; h ≤ w ≤ N$. We can verify that $G(10) = 55$, $G({10}^3) = 971\\,745$ and $G({10}^5) = 9\\,992\\,617\\,687$.</p>\n<p>Find $G({10}^{12})$.
