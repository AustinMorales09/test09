You have to build a wall around the land that you stake out, and building a wall on the moon is expensive. Every country has been allotted a 500 m by 500 m square area, but they will possess only that area which they wall in. 251001 posts have been placed in a rectangular grid with 1 meter spacing. The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.</p>\n<p>The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire 250 000 $\\text{m}^2$ area. The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum $\\frac{\\text{enclosed-area}}{\\text{wall-length}}$ ratio.</p>\n<p>You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper. For a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 $\\text{m}^2$ area the $\\frac{\\text{enclosed-area}}{\\text{wall-length}}$ ratio is 125.</p>\n<p>Although not allowed, but to get an idea if this is anything better: if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to $π \\times {250}^2 \\text{m}^2$ and the perimeter will be $π \\times 500 \\text{m}$, so the $\\frac{\\text{enclosed-area}}{\\text{wall-length}}$ ratio will also be 125.</p>\n<p>However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and $75\\sqrt{2}$ m the total area becomes 238750 $\\text{m}^2$ and the perimeter becomes $1400 + 300\\sqrt{2}$ m. So this gives an $\\frac{\\text{enclosed-area}}{\\text{wall-length}}$ ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"picture showing difference in enclosed-area between circle and square with cut off four triangles\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/the-mouse-on-the-moon.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>Find the maximum $\\frac{\\text{enclosed-area}}{\\text{wall-length}}$ ratio.
