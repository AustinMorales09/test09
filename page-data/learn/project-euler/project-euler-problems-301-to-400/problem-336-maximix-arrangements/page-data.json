However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order.</p>\n<p>To rearrange the carriages, they are all shunted onto a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point, the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180Â°. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.</p>\n<p>Some arrangements, such as $ADCB$, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between $A$ and $D$, and after $DCB$ are rotated the correct order has been achieved.</p>\n<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage $A$ in the correct place, then carriage $B$, and so on.</p>\n<p>Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are $DACB$ and $DBAC$; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for $DACB$ is shown below.</p>\n<img class=\"img-responsive center-block\" alt=\"five rotations for maximix arrangement DACB\" src=\"https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/maximix-arrangements.gif\" style=\"background-color: white; padding: 10px;\">\n<p>It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is $DFAECB$.</p>\n<p>Find the ${2011}^{\\text{th}}$ lexicographic maximix arrangement for eleven carriages.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f4bd1000cf542c50ffcf","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301994,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-336-maximix-arrangements","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>maximixArrangements()</code> should return a string.</p>","testString":"assert(typeof maximixArrangements() === 'string');"},{"text":"<p><code>maximixArrangements()</code> should return the string <code>CAGBIHEFJDK</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(maximixArrangements(), 'CAGBIHEFJDK');"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function maximixArrangements() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\nmaximixArrangements();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-301-to-400","dashedName":"problem-336-maximix-arrangements","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-337-totient-stairstep-sequences","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-335-gathering-the-beans","id":"5900f4bd1000cf542c50ffcf"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-336-maximix-arrangements"}},
