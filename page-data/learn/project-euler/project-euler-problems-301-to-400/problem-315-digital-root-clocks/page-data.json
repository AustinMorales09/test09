For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: <code>137</code> → <code>11</code> → <code>2</code> and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.</p>\n<p>Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Number <code>1</code> is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number <code>4</code> is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number <code>8</code> lights them all.</p>\n<p>The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off. To turn on a <code>2</code> will cost 5 transitions, while a <code>7</code> will cost only 4 transitions.</p>\n<p>Sam and Max built two different clocks.</p>\n<p>Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows <code>137</code>, then the panel is turned off, then the next number (<code>11</code>) is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (<code>2</code>) is turned on and, after some time, off.</p>\n<p>For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>137</code>: $(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22$ transitions (<code>137</code> on/off).</li>\n<li><code>11</code>: $(2 + 2) × 2 = 8$ transitions (<code>11</code> on/off).</li>\n<li><code>2</code>: $(5) × 2 = 10$ transitions (<code>2</code> on/off).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a grand total of 40 transitions.</p>\n<p>Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.</p>\n<p>For number 137, Max's clock requires:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>137</code> : $2 + 5 + 4 = 11$ transitions (<code>137</code> on), $7$ transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number <code>11</code>).</li>\n<li><code>11</code> : $0$ transitions (number <code>11</code> is already turned on correctly), $3$ transitions (to turn off the first <code>1</code> and the bottom part of the second <code>1</code>; the top part is common with number <code>2</code>).</li>\n<li><code>2</code> : $4$ transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a <code>2</code>), $5$ transitions (to turn off number <code>2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a grand total of 30 transitions.</p>\n<p>Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one. The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between $A = {10}^7$ and $B = 2 × {10}^7$. Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.</p>\n</section>","id":"5900f4a71000cf542c50ffba","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":null,"notes":null,"challengeType":1,"helpCategory":"Euler","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"project-euler","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301971,"fields":{"blockName":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-315-digital-root-clocks","tests":[{"text":"<p><code>digitalRootClocks()</code> should return <code>13625242</code>.</p>","testString":"assert.strictEqual(digitalRootClocks(), 13625242);"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"scriptjs","ext":"js","name":"script","contents":"function digitalRootClocks() {\n\n  return true;\n}\n\ndigitalRootClocks();","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["script.js"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/project-euler/#project-euler-problems-301-to-400","dashedName":"problem-315-digital-root-clocks","certification":"project-euler","disableLoopProtectTests":true,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"project-euler","block":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"project-euler-problems-301-to-400","nextChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-316-numbers-in-decimal-expansions","prevChallengePath":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-314-the-mouse-on-the-moon","id":"5900f4a71000cf542c50ffba"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":1,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"script","ext":"js","contents":"// solution required","head":"","tail":"","history":["script.js"],"fileKey":"scriptjs"}]}},"slug":"/learn/project-euler/project-euler-problems-301-to-400/problem-315-digital-root-clocks"}},
