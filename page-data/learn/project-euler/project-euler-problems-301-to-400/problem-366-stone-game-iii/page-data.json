So let's say he also takes one stone, leaving 2.</p>\n<p>The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.</p>\n<p>So 5 is a losing position for the first player.</p>\n<p>For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.</p>\n<p>E.g. when $n = 17$ the first player can remove one or four stones.</p>\n<p>Let $M(n)$ be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position at his first turn and $M(n) = 0$ for any other position.</p>\n<p>$\\sum M(n)$ for $n ≤ 100$ is 728.</p>\n<p>Find $\\sum M(n)$ for $n ≤ {10}^{18}$.
