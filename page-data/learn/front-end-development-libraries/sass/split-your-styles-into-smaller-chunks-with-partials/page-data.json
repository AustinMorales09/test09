These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.</p>\n<p>Names for partials start with the underscore (<code>_</code>) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the <code>.scss</code> file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the <code>@import</code> directive.</p>\n<p>For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named \"_mixins.scss\", and they are needed in the \"main.scss\" file, this is how to use them in the main file:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-scss\">@import 'mixins'\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the <code>import</code> statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.</p>\n</section>","id":"587d7dbf367417b2b2512bbc","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Write an <code>@import</code> statement to import a partial named <code>_variables.scss</code> into the main.scss file.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"challengeType":0,"helpCategory":"HTML-CSS","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"front-end-development-libraries","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301459,"fields":{"blockName":"sass","slug":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/sass/split-your-styles-into-smaller-chunks-with-partials","tests":[{"text":"<p>Your code should use the <code>@import</code> directive, and should not include the underscore in the file name.</p>","testString":"assert(code.match(/@import\\s+?('|\")variables\\1/gi));"}]},"required":[],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"indexhtml","ext":"html","name":"index","contents":"<!-- The main.scss file -->","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["index.html"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#sass","dashedName":"split-your-styles-into-smaller-chunks-with-partials","certification":"front-end-development-libraries","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"front-end-development-libraries","block":"sass","isFirstStep":false,"template":null,"required":[],"nextBlock":"sass","nextChallengePath":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/sass/extend-one-set-of-css-styles-to-another-element","prevChallengePath":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/sass/apply-a-style-until-a-condition-is-met-with-while","id":"587d7dbf367417b2b2512bbc"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":0,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"index","ext":"html","contents":"<style type='text/scss'>\n  h3{\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  .info{\n    width: 200px;\n    border: 1px solid black;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n  }\n  .info-important{\n    @extend .info;\n    background-color: magenta;\n  }\n\n\n\n</style>\n<h3>Posts</h3>\n<div class=\"info-important\">\n  <p>This is an important post.
