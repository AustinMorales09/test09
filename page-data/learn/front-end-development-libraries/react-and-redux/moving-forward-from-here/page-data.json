You finished the lessons on React and Redux. There's one last item worth pointing out before you move on. Typically, you won't write React apps in a code editor like this. This challenge gives you a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you're working with a file system on your own machine. The code should look similar, except for the use of <code>import</code> statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges).</p>\n<p>Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration. This can get complicated quickly. If you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, the <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Create React App</a> comes configured and ready to go.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.</p>\n</section>","id":"5a24c314108439a4d403614a","hasEditableBoundaries":false,"instructions":"<section id=\"instructions\">\n<p>Log the message <code>'Now I know React and Redux!'</code> to the console.</p>\n</section>","notes":null,"challengeType":6,"helpCategory":"JavaScript","videoUrl":null,"superBlock":"front-end-development-libraries","translationPending":false,"forumTopicId":301434,"fields":{"blockName":"react-and-redux","slug":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react-and-redux/moving-forward-from-here","tests":[{"text":"<p>The message <code>Now I know React and Redux!</code> should be logged to the console.</p>","testString":"(getUserInput) =>\n  assert(\n    /console\\s*\\.\\s*log\\s*\\(\\s*('|\"|`)Now I know React and Redux!\\1\\s*\\)/.test(\n      getUserInput('index')\n    )\n  );"}]},"required":[{"link":null,"src":"https://unpkg.com/react@16.4.0/umd/react.production.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.4.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/3.7.2/redux.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-redux/5.0.7/react-redux.min.js"}],"usesMultifileEditor":false,"challengeFiles":[{"fileKey":"indexjsx","ext":"jsx","name":"index","contents":"/*\nimport React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux'\nimport { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport thunk from 'redux-thunk'\n\nimport rootReducer from './redux/reducers'\nimport App from './components/App'\n\nconst store = createStore(\n  rootReducer,\n  applyMiddleware(thunk)\n);\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Provider store={store}>\n    <App/>\n  </Provider>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n*/\n\n// Only change code below this line","head":"","tail":"","editableRegionBoundaries":[],"history":["index.jsx"]}]}}},"pageContext":{"challengeMeta":{"blockHashSlug":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react-and-redux","dashedName":"moving-forward-from-here","certification":"front-end-development-libraries","disableLoopProtectTests":false,"disableLoopProtectPreview":false,"superBlock":"front-end-development-libraries","block":"react-and-redux","isFirstStep":false,"template":"<body><div id='root'></div>${ source || '' }</body>","required":[{"link":null,"src":"https://unpkg.com/react@16.4.0/umd/react.production.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16.4.0/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/redux/3.7.2/redux.min.js"},{"link":null,"src":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-redux/5.0.7/react-redux.min.js"}],"nextBlock":"front-end-development-libraries-projects","nextChallengePath":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine","prevChallengePath":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react-and-redux/extract-local-state-into-redux","id":"5a24c314108439a4d403614a"},"projectPreview":{"showProjectPreview":false,"challengeData":{"challengeType":6,"challengeFiles":[{"name":"index","ext":"jsx","contents":"console.log('Now I know React and Redux!');","head":"","tail":"","history":["index.jsx"],"fileKey":"indexjsx"}]}},"slug":"/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react-and-redux/moving-forward-from-here"}},
