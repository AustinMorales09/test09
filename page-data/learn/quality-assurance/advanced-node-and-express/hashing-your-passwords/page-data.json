Now it is time to implement BCrypt to solve this issue.</p>\n<p><code>bcrypt@~5.0.0</code> has already been added as a dependency, so require it in your server. You will need to handle hashing in 2 key areas: where you handle registering/saving a new account, and when you check to see that a password is correct on login.</p>\n<p>Currently on your registration route, you insert a user's plaintext password into the database like so: <code>password: req.body.password</code>. Hash the passwords instead by adding the following before your database logic: <code>const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(req.body.password, 12);</code>, and replacing the <code>req.body.password</code> in the database saving with just <code>password: hash</code>.</p>\n<p>On your authentication strategy, you check for the following in your code before completing the process: <code>if (password !== user.password) return done(null, false);</code>. After making the previous changes, now <code>user.password</code> is a hash. Before making a change to the existing code, notice how the statement is checking if the password is <strong>not</strong> equal then return non-authenticated. With this in mind, change that code to look as follows to properly check the password entered against the hash:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-js\">if (!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) { \n  return done(null, false);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is all it takes to implement one of the most important security features when you have to store passwords.</p>\n<p>Submit your page when you think you've got it right.
